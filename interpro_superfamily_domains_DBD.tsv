IPR009057	Homedomain-like superfamily	<p>Homeodomain (HD)-containing proteins are transcription factors that share a related DNA binding domain [[cite:PUB00013192]]. HD was first identified in a number of Drosophila homeotic and segmentation proteins, but is now known to be well conserved in organisms from all domains in life. The domain binds DNA through a helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure. The HTH motif is characterised by two α-helices, which make intimate contacts with the DNA and are joined by a short turn. The second helix binds to DNA via a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which occur between specific side chains and the exposed bases and thymine methyl groups within the major groove of the DNA. The first helix helps to stabilise the structure. Many proteins contain homeodomains, including Drosophila Engrailed, yeast mating type proteins, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a and HOX proteins.</p>  <p>The homeodomain motif is very similar in sequence and structure to domains in a wide range of DNA-binding proteins, including recombinases, Myb proteins, GARP response regulators, human telomeric proteins (hTRF1), paired domain proteins (PAX), yeast RAP1, centromere-binding proteins CENP-B and ABP-1, transcriptional regulators (TyrR), AraC-type transcriptional activators, and tetracycline repressor-like proteins (TetR, QacR, YcdC) [[cite:PUB00013193], [cite:PUB00013194], [cite:PUB00003347]].</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR036910	High mobility group box domain superfamily	<p>High mobility group (HMG) box domains are involved in binding DNA, and may be involved in protein-protein interactions as well. The structure of the HMG-box domain consists of three helices in an irregular array. HMG-box domains are found in one or more copies in HMG-box proteins, which form a large, diverse family involved in the regulation of DNA-dependent processes such as transcription, replication, and strand repair, all of which require the bending and unwinding of chromatin. Many of these proteins are regulators of gene expression. HMG-box proteins are found in a variety of eukaryotic organisms, and can be broadly divided into two groups, based on sequence-dependent and sequence-independent DNA recognition; the former usually contain one HMG-box motif, while the latter can contain multiple HMG-box motifs.</p> <p>HMG-box domains can be found in single or multiple copies in the following protein classes:  HMG1 and HMG2 non-histone components of chromatin; SRY (sex determining region Y protein) involved in differential gonadogenesis; the SOX family of transcription factors [[cite:PUB00015128]]; sequence-specific LEF1 (lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1) and TCF-1 (T-cell factor 1) involved in regulation of organogenesis and thymocyte differentiation [[cite:PUB00015129]]; structure-specific recognition protein SSRP involved in transcription and replication; MTF1 mitochondrial transcription factor; nucleolar transcription factors UBF 1/2 (upstream binding factor) involved in transcription by RNA polymerase I; Abf2 yeast ARS-binding factor [[cite:PUB00015130]]; yeast transcription factors lxr1, Rox1, Nhp6b and Spp41; mating type proteins (MAT) involved in the sexual reproduction of fungi [[cite:PUB00015131]]; and the YABBY plant-specific transcription factors.</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR036051	Krueppel-associated box domain superfamily	<p>The Krueppel-associated box (KRAB) is a domain of around 75 amino acids that is found in the N-terminal part of about one third of eukaryotic Krueppel-type C2H2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) [[cite:PUB00011911]]. It is enriched in charged amino acids and can be divided into subregions A and B, which are predicted to fold into two amphipathic α-helices. The KRAB A and B boxes can be separated by variable spacer segments and many KRAB proteins contain only the A box [[cite:PUB00007161]].</p>  <p>The functions currently known for members of the KRAB-containing protein family include transcriptional repression of RNA polymerase I, II and III promoters, binding and splicing of RNA, and control of nucleolus function. The KRAB domain functions as a transcriptional repressor when tethered to the template DNA by a DNA-binding domain. A sequence of 45 amino acids in the KRAB A subdomain has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for transcriptional repression. The B box does not repress by itself but does potentiate the repression exerted by the KRAB A subdomain [[cite:PUB00007162], [cite:PUB00007163]]. Gene silencing requires the binding of the KRAB domain to the RING-B box-coiled coil (RBCC) domain of the KAP-1/TIF1-beta corepressor. As KAP-1 binds to the heterochromatin proteins HP1, it has been proposed that the KRAB-ZFP-bound target gene could be silenced following recruitment to heterochromatin [[cite:PUB00007164], [cite:PUB00007165]].</p>  <p>KRAB-ZFPs probably constitute the single largest class of transcription factors within the human genome [[cite:PUB00007166]]. The KRAB domain is generally encoded by two exons. The regions coded by the two exons are known as KRAB-A and KRAB-B. Although the function of KRAB-ZFPs is largely unknown, they appear to play important roles during cell differentiation and development. These proteins have been shown to play important roles in cell differentiation and organ development, and in regulating viral replication and transcription. A KRAB domain may consist of an A-box, or of an A-box plus either a B-box, a divergent B-box (b), or a C-box. Only the A-box is included in this model. The A-box is needed for repression, the B- and C- boxes are not. KRAB-ZFPs have one or two KRAB domains at their amino-terminal end, and multiple C2H2 zinc finger motifs at their C-termini. Some KRAB-ZFPs also contain a SCAN domain which mediates homo- and hetero-oligomerization. The KRAB domain is a protein-protein interaction module which represses transcription through recruiting corepressors. A key mechanism appears to be the following: KRAB-AFPs tethered to DNA recruit, via their KRAB domain, the repressor KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein-1, also known as transcription intermediary factor 1 beta, KRAB-A interacting protein and tripartite motif protein 28). The KAP1/ KRAB-AFP complex in turn recruits the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family, and other chromatin modulating proteins, leading to transcriptional repression through heterochromatin formation [[cite:PUB00097514]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036236	Zinc finger C2H2 superfamily	<p>C2H2-type (classical) zinc fingers (Znf) were the first class to be characterised. They contain a short β-hairpin and an α-helix (β/β/α structure), where a single zinc atom is held in place by Cys(2)His(2) (C2H2) residues in a tetrahedral array. C2H2 Znf's can be divided into three groups based on the number and pattern of fingers: triple-C2H2 (binds single ligand), multiple-adjacent-C2H2 (binds multiple ligands), and separated paired-C2H2 [[cite:PUB00035808]]. C2H2 Znf's are the most common DNA-binding motifs found in eukaryotic transcription factors, and have also been identified in prokaryotes [[cite:PUB00035809]].  Transcription factors usually contain several Znf's (each with a conserved β/β/α structure) capable of making multiple contacts along the DNA, where the C2H2 Znf motifs recognise DNA sequences by binding to the major groove of DNA via a short α-helix in the Znf, the Znf spanning 3-4 bases of the DNA [[cite:PUB00035811]]. C2H2 zinc fingers can also bind to RNA and protein targets [[cite:PUB00043274]].</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR012340	Nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold	<p>A five-stranded β-barrel was first noted as a common structure among four proteins binding single-stranded nucleic acids (staphylococcal nuclease and aspartyl-tRNA synthetase) or oligosaccharides (B subunits of enterotoxin and verotoxin-1), and has been termed the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding motif, or OB fold, a five-stranded β-sheet coiled to form a closed β-barrel capped by an α helix located between the third and fourth strands [[cite:PUB00016307]]. Two ribosomal proteins, S17 and S1, are members of this class and have different variations of the OB fold theme. Comparisons with other OB fold nucleic acid binding proteins suggest somewhat different mechanisms of nucleic acid recognition in each case [[cite:PUB00011768]].</p>  <p>There are many nucleic acid-binding proteins that contain domains with this OB-fold structure, including:</p>  <ul><li>Large ribosomal subunit protein uL2</li>   <li>Small ribosomal subunit protein uS12</li>   <li>DNA ligase</li>   <li>Polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase</li>   <li>Phage ssDNA-binding proteins (gp32, gp2.5, gpV)</li>   <li>Holliday junction branch migration complex subunit RuvA</li>   <li>Elongation factor P</li></ul>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036390	Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily	"<p>Winged helix DNA-binding proteins share a related winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, where the ""wings"", or loops, are small β-sheets. The winged helix motif consists of two wings (W1, W2), three α-helices (H1, H2, H3) and three β-sheets (S1, S2, S3) arranged in the order H1-S1-H2-H3-S2-W1-S3-W2 [[cite:PUB00013195]]. The DNA-recognition helix makes sequence-specific DNA contacts with the major groove of DNA, while the wings make different DNA contacts, often with the minor groove or the backbone of DNA. Several winged-helix proteins display an exposed patch of hydrophobic residues thought to mediate protein-protein interactions.</p>"	TRUE	FALSE
IPR036647	GTF2I-like repeat superfamily	<p>This region of sequence similarity is found up to six times in a variety of proteins including general transcription factor II-I (GTF2I). It has been suggested that this may be a DNA binding domain [[cite:PUB00007426], [cite:PUB00007427]].</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR037241	E2F-DP heterodimerization region	<p>The E2F transcription factors associated with the corresponding domain of the DP transcription factor forming an heterodimer fold with the N-terminal long helices of both chains forming a parallel coiled coil and their C-terminal folded β-hairpins interlocking together in a β-sandwich. This complex binds the C terminus of retinoblastoma protein [[cite:PUB00035382]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036638	Helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain superfamily	<p>This domain is found in a number of eukaryotic proteins, which probably are sequence specific DNA-binding proteins that act as transcription factors, share a conserved domain of 40 to 50 amino acid residues. It has been proposed [[cite:PUB00000825]] that this domain is formed of two amphipathic helices joined by a variable length linker region that could form a loop. This 'helix-loop-helix' (HLH) domain mediates protein dimerisation and has been found in the proteins listed below [[cite:PUB00001514]]. Most of these proteins have an extra basic region of about 15 amino acid residues that is adjacent to the HLH domain and specifically binds to DNA. They are referred as basic helix-loop-helix proteins (bHLH), and are classified in two groups: class A (ubiquitous) and class B (tissue-specific). Members of the bHLH family bind variations on the core sequence 'CANNTG', also referred to as the E-box motif. The homo- or heterodimerisation mediated by the HLH domain is independent of, but necessary for DNA binding, as two basic regions are required for DNA binding activity. The HLH proteins lacking the basic domain (Emc, Id) function as negative regulators, since they form heterodimers, but fail to bind DNA. The hairy-related proteins (hairy, E(spl), deadpan) also repress transcription although they can bind DNA. The proteins of this subfamily act together with co-repressor proteins, like groucho, through their -terminal motif WRPW.</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR013761	Sterile alpha motif/pointed domain superfamily	<p>Sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains are known to be involved in diverse protein-protein interactions, associating with both SAM-containing and non-SAM-containing proteins pathway [[cite:PUB00014041]]. SAM domains exhibit a conserved structure, consisting of a 4-5-helical bundle of two orthogonally packed α-hairpins. However SAM domains display a diversity of function, being involved in interactions with proteins, DNA and RNA [[cite:PUB00014042]]. The name sterile alpha motif arose from its presence in proteins that are essential for yeast sexual differentiation. The SAM domain has had various names, including SPM, PTN (pointed), SEP (yeast sterility, Ets-related, PcG proteins), NCR (N-terminal conserved region) and HLH (helix-loop-helix) domain, all of which are related and can be classified as SAM domains.</p> <p>SAM domains occur in eukaryotic and in some bacterial proteins. Structures have been determined for several proteins that contain SAM domains, including Ets-1 transcription factor, which plays a role in the development and invasion of tumour cells by regulating the expression of matrix-degrading proteases [[cite:PUB00014043]]; Etv6 transcription factor, gene rearrangements of which have been demonstrated in several malignancies [[cite:PUB00014044]]; EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase, which is believed to be important for the correct localization of a motoneuron pool to a specific position in the spinal cord [[cite:PUB00014045]]; EphB2 receptor, which is involved in spine morphogenesis via intersectin, Cdc42 and N-Wasp [[cite:PUB00014046]]; p73, a p53 homologue involved in neuronal development [[cite:PUB00014047]]; and polyhomeotic, which is a member of the Polycomb group of genes (Pc-G) required for the maintenance of the spatial expression pattern of homeotic genes [[cite:PUB00014048]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR011011	Zinc finger, FYVE/PHD-type	<p>The FYVE zinc finger domain is conserved from yeast to man, and is named after four proteins that it has been found in: Fab1, YOTB/ZK632.12, Vac1, and EEA1. It functions in the membrane recruitment of cytosolic proteins by binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), which is found mainly on endosomes [[cite:PUB00014078], [cite:PUB00014077]].</p>  <p>The plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger domain has a C4HC3-type motif, and is widely distributed in eukaryotes, being found in many chromatin regulatory factors [[cite:PUB00014079]].</p>  <p>Both the FYVE and the PHD zinc finger motifs display strikingly similar dimetal(zinc)-bound α+β folds.</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR011333	SKP1/BTB/POZ domain superfamily	<p>The BTB (for BR-C, ttk and bab) [[cite:PUB00004829]] or POZ (for Pox virus and Zinc finger) [[cite:PUB00001918], [cite:PUB00035688]] domain is a versatile protein-protein interaction motif involved in many cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation, cytoskeleton dynamics, ion channel assembly and gating, and targeting proteins for ubiquitination [[cite:PUB00033636]]. The BTB domain can occur alongside other domains: BTB-zinc finger (BTB-ZF), BTB-BACK-Kelch (BBK), voltage-gated potassium channel T1 (T1-Kv) [[cite:PUB00035689]], MATH-BTB, BTB-NPH3 and BTB-BACK-PHR (BBP). Other proteins, such as Skp1 and ElonginC, consist almost exclusively of the core BTB fold. In all of these protein families, the BTB core fold is structurally conserved, consisting of a 2-layer α/β topology where a cluster of α-helices is flanked by short β-sheets [[cite:PUB00004917]]. POZ domains from several zinc finger proteins have been shown to mediate transcriptional repression and to interact with components of histone deacetylase co-repressor complexes including N-CoR and SMRT [[cite:PUB00000971], [cite:PUB00004499], [cite:PUB00003026]]. The POZ or BTB domain is also known as BR-C/Ttk or ZiN.</p>  <p>This entry includes the BTB/POZ domain, as well as  Skp1 N-terminal region which has an α/β structure similar to that of the BTB/POZ domain fold [[cite:PUB00035689], [cite:PUB00010628]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR035500	Nuclear hormone receptor-like domain superfamily	<p>Steroid or nuclear hormone receptors constitute an important superfamily of transcription regulators that are involved in widely diverse physiological functions, including control of embryonic development, cell differentiation and homeostasis. The receptors function as dimeric molecules in nuclei to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner. Nuclear hormone receptors consist of a highly conserved DNA-binding domain that recognises specific sequences ([interpro:IPR001628]), connected via a linker region to a C-terminal ligand-binding domain. In addition, certain nuclear hormone receptors have an N-terminal modulatory domain ([interpro:IPR046944]). The ligand-binding domain acts in response to ligand binding, which caused a conformational change in the receptor to induce a response, thereby acting as a molecular switch to turn on transcriptional activity [[cite:PUB00016720]]. For example, after binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to the corticosteroid ligand, the receptor is induced to perform functions ranging from nuclear translocation, oligomerization, cofactor/kinase/transcription factor association, and DNA binding [[cite:PUB00016721]]. The ligand-binding domain is a flexible unit, where the binding of a ligand stabilises its conformation, which in turn favours coactivator binding to modify receptor activity [[cite:PUB00016722]]; the coactivator can bind to the activator function 2 (AF2) site at the C-terminal end of the ligand-binding domain [[cite:PUB00016725]]. The binding of different ligands can alter the conformation of the ligand-binding domain, which ultimately affects the DNA-binding specificity of the DNA-binding domain. In the absence of ligand, steroid hormone receptors are thought to be weakly associated with nuclear components.</p>  <p>This entry represents the all helical domain involved in ligand-binding.</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR008967	p53-like transcription factor, DNA-binding domain superfamily	<p>This domain superfamily is found in a number of transcription factors, including p53, NFATC, TonEBP, STAT-1, and NFkappaB, where it is responsible for DNA-binding.  These transcription factors play diverse roles in the regulation of cellular functions: the p53 tumour suppressor upregulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [[cite:PUB00011797]]; NFATC regulates the production of effector proteins involved in coordinating the immune response [[cite:PUB00011799]]; TonEBP regulates gene expression induced by osmotic stress and helps regulate intracellular volume during cell growth [[cite:PUB00011802]]; STAT-1 plays an important role in B lymphocyte growth and function [[cite:PUB00011801]]; and NFkappaB is involved in the inflammatory response [[cite:PUB00011803]].  The DNA-binding domain acts to clamp, or in the case of TonEBP, encircle the DNA target in order to stabilise the protein-DNA complex [[cite:PUB00011800]].  Protein interactions may also serve to stabilise the protein-DNA complex, for example in the STAT-1 dimer the SH2 (Src homology 2) domain in each monomer is coupled to the DNA-binding domain to increase stability [[cite:PUB00011807]].  The DNA-binding domain consists of a β-sandwich formed of 9 strands in 2 sheets with a Greek-key topology. This structure is found in many transcription factors, often within the DNA-binding domain.</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR010982	Lambda repressor-like, DNA-binding domain superfamily	<p>Bacteriophage lambda C1 repressor controls the expression of viral genes as part of the lysogeny/lytic growth switch. C1 is essential for maintaining lysogeny, where the phage replicates non-disruptively along with the host. If the host cell is threatened, then lytic growth is induced. The Lambda C1 repressor consists of two domains connected by a linker: an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that also mediates interactions with RNA polymerase, and a C-terminal dimerisation domain [[cite:PUB00014015]]. The DNA-binding domain consists of four helices in a closed folded leaf motif. Several different phage repressors from different helix-turn-helix families contain DNA-binding domains that adopt a similar topology. These include the Lambda Cro repressor, Bacteriophage 434 C1 and Cro repressors, P22 C2 repressor, and Bacteriophage Mu Ner protein.</p> <p>The DNA-binding domain of Bacillus subtilis spore inhibition repressor SinR is identical to that of phage repressors [[cite:PUB00014013]]. SinR represses sporulation, which only occurs in response to adverse conditions. This provides a possible evolutionary link between the two adaptive responses of bacterial sporulation and prophage induction.</p> <p>Other DNA-binding domains also display similar structural folds to that of Lambda C1. These include bacterial regulators such as the purine repressor (PurR), the lactose repressor (Lacr) and the fructose repressor (FruR), each of which has an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that exhibits a fold similar to that of lambda C1, except that they lack the first helix [[cite:PUB00014016], [cite:PUB00014017], [cite:PUB00014018]]. POU-specific domains found in transcription factors such as in Oct-1, Pit-1 and Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a (LFB1/HNF1) display four-helical fold DNA-binding domains similar to that of Lambda C1 [[cite:PUB00014019], [cite:PUB00007265], [cite:PUB00014020]]. The N-terminal domain of cyanase has an α-helix bundle motif similar to Lambda C1, but it probably does not bind DNA. Cyanase is an enzyme found in bacteria and plants that catalyses the reaction of cyanate with bicarbonate to produce ammonia and carbon dioxide in response to extracellular cyanate [[cite:PUB00008198]].</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR035965	PAS domain superfamily	<p>PAS domains are involved in many signalling proteins where they are used as a signal sensor domain [[cite:PUB00015791]]. PAS domains appear in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. Several PAS-domain proteins are known to detect their signal by way of an associated cofactor. Heme, flavin, and a 4-hydroxycinnamyl chromophore are used in different proteins. The PAS domain was named after three proteins that it occurs in:</p> <ul> <li>Per- period circadian protein</li> <li>Arnt- Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein</li> <li>Sim-  single-minded protein.</li> </ul> <p>PAS domains are often associated with PAC domains [interpro:IPR001610].  It appears that these domains are directly linked, and that together they form the conserved 3D PAS fold.  The division between the PAS and PAC domains is caused by major differences in sequences in the region connecting these two motifs [[cite:PUB00014500]].  In human PAS kinase, this region has been shown to be very flexible, and adopts different conformations depending on the bound ligand [[cite:PUB00014501]]. Probably the most surprising identification of a PAS domain was that in EAG-like K<sup></sup>-channels [[cite:PUB00005472]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR046347	Basic-leucine zipper domain superfamily	<p>The basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain transcription factors [[cite:PUB00004967]] of eukaryotic are proteins that contain a basic region mediating sequence-specific DNA-binding followed by a leucine zipper region required for dimerisation.</p>  <p>Several structure of bZIP have been solved. The basic region and the leucine zipper form a contiguous α-helix where the four hydrophobic residues of the leucine zipper are oriented on one side. This conformation allows dimerisation in parallel and it bends the helices so that the newly functional dimer forms a flexible fork where the basic domains, at the N-terminal open end, can then interact with DNA. The two leucine zipper are therefore oriented perpendicular to the DNA [[cite:PUB00017872]].</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR008917	Transcription factor, Skn-1-like, DNA-binding domain superfamily	<p>The DNA-binding domain of certain eukaryotic transcription factors displays a distinctive helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif.  The MafG basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) protein and the Caenorhabditis elegans Skn-1 transcription factor share this HTH motif.</p> <p>MafG is a member of the Maf family of proteins, which are a subgroup of bZIP proteins that function as transcriptional regulators of cellular differentiation.  Mafs can form either homodimers, or heterodimers with other bZIP proteins through their leucine zipper domains.  MafG proteins are small Mafs that lack a putative transactivation domain.  The DNA-binding domain of MafG contains the conserved Maf extended homology region (EHR), which is not present in other bZIP proteins.  The EHR together with the basic region are responsible for the DNA-binding specificity of Mafs.</p> <p>Skn-1 is a transcription factor that specifies mesodermal development in C. elegans.  Skn-1 and MafG share a conserved DNA-binding motif, however Skn-1 lacks the leucine zipper dimerisation domain that is found in all bZIP proteins.  Skn-1 acts as a monomer.</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR046341	SET domain superfamily	<p>The SET domain is a 130 to 140 amino acid, evolutionary well conserved sequence motif that was initially characterised in the Drosophila proteins Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste and Trithorax [[cite:PUB00018233], [cite:PUB00014448]]. In eukaryotic organisms, it appears in proteins with an important role in regulating chromatin-mediated gene transcriptional activation and silencing. In viruses,bacteria and archaea, its function is not clear yet [[cite:PUB00099756]].</p>  <p>This superfamily includes eukaryotic proteins with histone methyltransferase activity, which requires the combination of the SET domain with the adjacent cysteine-rich regions, one located N-terminally (pre-SET) and the other posterior to the SET domain (post-SET). Post- and pre- SET regions seem then to play a crucial role when it comes to substrate recognition and enzymatic activity [[cite:PUB00054125], [cite:PUB00007133]]. Other SET domain-containing proteins function as transcription factors (such as PR domain zinc finger protein 1 from humans [[cite:PUB00099755]]).</p>  <p>The structure of the SET domain and the two adjacent regions pre-SET and post-SET have been solved [[cite:PUB00018235], [cite:PUB00018236], [cite:PUB00018237]]. The SET domain structure is all-β, but consists only in sets of few short strands composing no more than a couple of small sheets. Consequently the SET structure is mostly defined by turns and loops. An unusual feature is that the SET core is made up of two discontinuous segments of the primary sequence forming an approximate L-shape [[cite:PUB00005822], [cite:PUB00054125], [cite:PUB00007133]]. Two of the most conserved motifs in the SET domain are constituted by a stretch at the C-terminal containing a strictly conserved tyrosine residue and a preceding loop inside which the C-terminal segment passes forming a knot-like structure, but not quite a true knot. These two regions have been proven to be essential for SAM binding and catalysis, particularly the invariant tyrosine where in all likelihood catalysis takes place [[cite:PUB00054125], [cite:PUB00007133]].</p>	FALSE	TRUE
IPR009060	UBA-like superfamily	<p>UBA domains are a commonly occurring sequence motif of approximately 45 amino acid residues that are found in diverse proteins involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, DNA excision-repair, and cell signalling via protein kinases [[cite:PUB00007089]]. HHR23A, the human homologue of yeast Rad23A is a nucleotide excision-repair protein that contains both an internal and a C-terminal UBA domain. The fold of the UBA domain consists of a compact three-helical bundle with a right-handed twist, and have a conserved hydrophobic surface patch for protein-protein interactions. UBA-like domains can be found in other proteins as well, such as the TS-N domain in the elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts), which catalyses the recycling of the GTPase EF-Tu required for the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA top the ribosomal A site [[cite:PUB00013202]]; and the C-terminal domain of TAP/NXF1, which functions in nuclear export through the interaction of its UBA-like domain with FG nucleoporins [[cite:PUB00013203]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036407	DM DNA-binding domain superfamily	<p>This entry represents the DM DNA-binding domain superfamily.</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR036879	Transcription factor, MADS-box superfamily	<p>Human serum response factor (SRF) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein important for cell proliferation and differentiation. SRF function is essential for transcriptional regulation of numerous growth-factor-inducible genes, such as c-fos oncogene and muscle-specific actin genes.  A core domain of around 90 amino acids is sufficient for the activities of DNA-binding, dimerisation and interaction with accessory factors. Within the core is a DNA-binding region, designated the MADS box [[cite:PUB00004216]], that is highly similar to many eukaryotic regulatory proteins: among these are MCM1, the regulator of cell type-specific genes in fission yeast; DSRF, a Drosophila trachea development factor; the MEF2 family of myocyte-specific enhancer factors; and the Agamous and Deficiens families of plant homeotic proteins.</p>  <p>In SRF, the MADS box has been shown to be involved in DNA-binding and dimerisation [[cite:PUB00000821]]. Proteins belonging to the MADS family function as dimers, the primary DNA-binding element of which is an anti-parallel coiled coil of two amphipathic α-helices, one from each subunit. The DNA wraps around the coiled coil allowing the basic N-termini of the helices to fit into the DNA major groove. The chain extending from the helix N-termini reaches over the DNA backbone and penetrates into the minor groove. A 4-stranded, anti-parallel β-sheet packs against the coiled-coil face opposite the DNA and is the central element of the dimerisation interface.  The MADS-box domain is commonly found associated with K-box region see ([interpro:IPR002487]).</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR035979	RNA-binding domain superfamily	<p>Many eukaryotic proteins containing one or more copies of a putative RNA-binding domain of about 90 amino acids are known to bind single-stranded RNAs [[cite:PUB00005341], [cite:PUB00034493], [cite:PUB00034494]]. The largest group of single strand RNA-binding proteins is the eukaryotic RNA recognition motif (RRM) family that contains an eight amino acid RNP-1 consensus sequence [[cite:PUB00001891], [cite:PUB00034495]]. RRM proteins have a variety of RNA binding preferences and functions, and include heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing (SR, U2AF, Sxl), protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1 and U2 snRNPs), and proteins that regulate RNA stability and translation (PABP, La, Hu) [[cite:PUB00034493], [cite:PUB00034494], [cite:PUB00034495]]. The RRM in heterodimeric splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) appears to have two RRM-like domains with specialised features for protein recognition [[cite:PUB00016352]]. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins.</p>  <p>The typical RRM consists of four anti-parallel β-strands and two α-helices arranged in a β-α-β-β-α-β fold with side chains that stack with RNA bases. Specificity of RNA binding is determined by multiple contacts with surrounding amino acids. A third helix is present during RNA binding in some cases [[cite:PUB00004440]]. The RRM is reviewed in a number of publications [[cite:PUB00034496], [cite:PUB00034497], [cite:PUB00034498]].</p>  <p>This entry also includes some bacterial putative RNA-binding proteins.</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR016194	SPOC-like, C-terminal domain superfamily	<p>This superfamily represents the Spen Paralogue and Orthologue C-terminal (SPOC) domain and its structural homologues. This domain has a closed β-barrel fold of complex topology. Proteins that carry a SPOC-like domain include:</p>  <ul> <li>Spen proteins, such as SHARP (SMRT/HDAC1-associated repressor protein), which carry a SPOC domain at the C-terminal and an RNA-binding motif in the N-terminal; Spen proteins regulate the expression of key transcriptional effectors in diverse signalling pathways, the SHARP protein being a component of transcriptional repression complexes in both nuclear receptor and Notch/RBP-Jkappa signalling pathways [[cite:PUB00013949]].</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>The middle domains of Ku70 and Ku80 (which includes the C-terminal α-helical arm and the DNA encircling insertion); the Ku heterodimer, which is composed of Ku70 and Ku80 subunits, contributes to genomic integrity through its ability to bind DNA double-strand breaks and facilitate repair by the non-homologous end-joining pathway [[cite:PUB00007947]].</li> </ul>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR009072	Histone-fold	<p>Histones mediate DNA organisation and play a dominant role in regulating eukaryotic transcription. The histone-fold consists of a core of three helices, where the long middle helix is flanked at each end by shorter ones. The histone fold is a structural element that facilitates heterodimerisation [[cite:PUB00060941], [cite:PUB00060942], [cite:PUB00039806]]. Proteins displaying this structure include the nucleosome core histones, which form octomers composed of two copies of each of the four histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4; archaeal histone, which possesses only the core domain part of eukaryotic histone; and the TATA-box binding protein (TBP)-associated factors (TAF), where the histone fold is a common motif for mediating TAF-TAF interactions. TAF proteins include TAF(II)18 and TAF(II)28, which form a heterodimer, TAF(II)42 and TAF(II)62, which form a heterotetramer similar to (H3-H4)2, and the negative cofactor 2 (NC2) alpha and beta chains, which form a heterodimer. The TAF proteins are a component of transcription factor IID (TFIID), along with the TBP protein. TFIID forms part of the pre-initiation complex on core promoter elements required for RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. The TAF subunits of TFIID mediate transcriptional activation of subsets of eukaryotic genes. The NC2 complex mediates the inhibition of TATA-dependent transcription through interactions with TBP.</p>	FALSE	TRUE
IPR010919	SAND-like domain superfamily	<p>The SAND domain (named after Sp100, AIRE-1, NucP41/75, DEAF-1) is a conserved ~80 residue region found in a number of nuclear proteins, many of which function in chromatin-dependent transcriptional control. These include proteins linked to various human diseases, such as the Sp100 (Speckled protein 100kDa), NUDR (Nuclear DEAF-1 related), GMEB (Glucocorticoid Modulatory Element Binding) proteins and AIRE-1 (Autoimmune regulator 1) proteins.</p>  <p>Proteins containing the SAND domain have a modular structure; the SAND domain can be associated with a number of other modules, including the bromodomain, the PHD finger and the MYND finger. Because no SAND domain has been found in yeast, it is thought that the SAND domain could be restricted to animal phyla. Many SAND domain-containing proteins, including NUDR, DEAF-1 (Deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1) and GMEB, have been shown to bind DNA sequences specifically. The SAND domain has been proposed to mediate the DNA binding activity of these proteins [[cite:PUB00005483], [cite:PUB00007101]]. Structurally, the SAND domain consists of a novel α/β fold, which has a core of three short helices packed against a barrel-like β-sheet; it is structurally similar to the SH3-like fold.</p>  <p>Other proteins display domains that are structurally similar to the SAND domain. One such example is the SMAD4-binding domain of the oncoprotein Ski, which is stabilised by a bound zinc atom, and resembles a SAND domain, in which the corresponding I loop is responsible for DNA binding. Ski is able to disrupt the formation of a functional complex between the Co- and R-SMADs, leading to the repression of TGF-beta, Activin and BMP responses, resulting in the repression of TGF-signalling [[cite:PUB00013959]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036427	Bromodomain-like superfamily	<p>Bromodomains are found in a variety of mammalian, invertebrate and yeast DNA-binding proteins [[cite:PUB00004405]]. Bromodomains are highly conserved α-helical motifs that can specifically interact with acetylated lysine residues on histone tails [[cite:PUB00005462], [cite:PUB00097275]]. In some proteins, the classical bromodomain has diverged to such an extent that parts of the region are either missing or contain an insertion (e.g., mammalian protein HRX, Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK783.4, yeast protein YTA7). The bromodomain may occur as a single copy, or in duplicate.</p>  <p>This domain is present in proteins involved in a wide range of functions such as acetylating histones, remodelling chromatin, and recruiting other factors necessary for transcription, thus playing a critical role in the regulation of transcription [[cite:PUB00097276]].</p>	FALSE	TRUE

Of these, the ""early"" set (E set) domains are possibly related to the immunoglobulin ([interpro:IPR007110]) and/or fibronectin type III ([interpro:IPR003961]) Ig-like protein superfamilies.

IPR036770	Ankyrin repeat-containing domain superfamily	<p>This entry represents the ankyrin repeat-containing domain. These domains contain multiple repeats of a β(2)-α(2) motif. The ankyrin repeat is one of the most common protein-protein interaction motifs in nature. Ankyrin repeats are tandemly repeated modules of about 33 amino acids. They occur in a large number of functionally diverse proteins mainly from eukaryotes. The few known examples from prokaryotes and viruses may be the result of horizontal gene transfers [[cite:PUB00006219]]. The repeat has been found in proteins of diverse function such as transcriptional initiators, cell-cycle regulators, cytoskeletal, ion transporters and signal transducers. The ankyrin fold appears to be defined by its structure rather than its function since there is no specific sequence or structure which is universally recognised by it.</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR027417	P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase	<p>The P-loop NTPase fold is the most prevalent domain of the several distinct nucleotide-binding protein folds.</p>  <p>The most common reaction catalysed by enzymes of the P-loop NTPase fold is the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphate bond of a bound nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). The energy from NTP hydrolysis is typically utilised to induce conformational changes in other molecules, which constitutes the basis of the biological functions of most P-loop NTPases. P-loop NTPases show substantial substrate preference for either ATP or GTP [[cite:PUB00064266]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR009110	Nuclear receptor coactivator, interlocking	<p>This superfamily represents the interlocking domain of various eukaryotic nuclear receptor coactivators, including CREBP, P300, Ncoa1, Ncoa2 and Ncoa3. The interlocking domain forms a 3-helical non-globular array that forms interlocked heterodimers with its target.</p> <p>Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors involved in the regulation of many processes, including development, reproduction and homeostasis. Nuclear receptor coactivators act to modulate the function of nuclear receptors. Coactivators associate with promoters and enhancers primarily through protein-protein contacts to facilitate the interaction between DNA-bound transcription factors and the transcription machinery. Many of these coactivators are structurally related, including CBP (CREB-binding protein), P300 and ACTR (activator for thyroid and retinoid receptors) [[cite:PUB00013275]]. CBP and P300 both have histone acetyltransferase activity ([ec:2.3.1.48]). CBP/P300 proteins function synergistically to activate transcription, acting to remodel chromatin and to recruit RNA polymerase II and the basal transcription machinery. CBP is required for proper cell cycle control, differentiation and apoptosis. The interaction of CBP/P300 with transcription factors involves several small domains. The IBiD domain in the C-terminal of CBP is responsible for CBP interaction with IRF-3, as well as with the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A, TIF-2 coactivator, and the IRF homologue KSHV IRF-1 [[cite:PUB00013276]].</p> <p>Ncoa1, Ncoa2 and Ncoa3 are all coactivators of various nuclear receptors.

IPR036867	R3H domain superfamily	<p>The R3H domain superfamily is a conserved sequence motif found in proteins from a diverse range of organisms including eubacteria, green plants, fungi and various groups of metazoans, but not in archaea and Escherichia coli. The domain is named R3H because it contains an invariant arginine and a highly conserved histidine, that are separated by three residues. It also displays a conserved pattern of hydrophobic residues, prolines and glycines. It can be found alone, in association with AAA domain or with various DNA/RNA binding domains like DSRM, KH, G-patch, PHD, DEAD box, or RRM. The functions of these domains indicate that the R3H domain might be involved in polynucleotide-binding, including DNA, RNA and single-stranded DNA [[cite:PUB00005485]].</p>  <p>The 3D structure of the R3H domain has been solved. The fold presents a small motif, consisting of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, against which two α-helices pack from one side. This fold is related to the structures of the YhhP protein and the C-terminal domain of the translational initiation factor IF3. Three conserved basic residues cluster on the same face of the R3H domain and could play a role in nucleic acid recognition. An extended hydrophobic area at a different site of the molecular surface could act as a protein-binding site [[cite:PUB00018517]].</p>	TRUE	FALSE

IPR029063	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily	<p>This entry represents  S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases (SAM MTase). Methyltransferases transfer a methyl group from a donor to an acceptor. SAM-binding methyltransferases utilise the ubiquitous methyl donor SAM as a cofactor to methylate proteins, small molecules, lipids, and nucleic acids. All SAM MTases contain a structurally conserved SAM-binding domain consisting of a central seven-stranded β-sheet that is flanked by three α-helices per side of the sheet [[cite:PUB00045026]].</p>  <p>A review published in 2003 [[cite:PUB00054125]] divides all methyltransferases into 5 classes based on the structure of their catalytic domain (fold):</p>  <ul> <li>class I: Rossmann-like α/β</li> <li>class II: TIM β/α-barrel α/β</li> <li>class III: tetrapyrrole methylase α/β</li> <li>class IV: SPOUT α/β</li> <li>class V: SET domain all β</li></ul>  <p>Another paper [[cite:PUB00057958]] based on a study of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae methyltransferome argues for four more folds:</p>  <ul> <li>class VI: transmembrane all-α</li> <li>class VII: DNA/RNA-binding 3-helical bundle all-α</li> <li>class VIII: SSo0622-like α+β</li> <li>class IX: thymidylate synthetase α+β</li></ul>  <p>The vast majority of methyltransferases belong to the Rossmann-like fold (Class I) which consists in a seven-stranded β-sheet adjoined by α-helices. The β-sheet contains a central topological switch-point resulting in a deep cleft in which SAM binds. Class I methyltransferases display two conserved positions, the first one is a GxGxG motif (or at least a GxG motif) at the end of the first β-strand which is characteristic of a nucleotide-binding site and is hence used to bind the adenosyl part of SAM, the second conserved position is an acidic residue at the end of the second β-strand that forms one hydrogen bond to each hydroxyl of the SAM ribose part. The core of these enzymes is composed by about 150 amino acids that show very strong spatial conservation [[cite:PUB00054125]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE

IPR008979	Galactose-binding-like domain superfamily	<p>Proteins containing a galactose-binding-like domain fold can be found in several different protein families, in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

IPR008969	Carboxypeptidase-like, regulatory domain superfamily	<p>This domain superfamily identifies a number of eukaryotic carboxypeptidases, these include carboxypeptidase D, E (H), N, X, X2 and Z. These are metallopeptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family M14 (clan MC), subfamily M14B.</p>  <p>Carboxypeptidase D (CPD) is a new B-type metallocarboxypeptidase that is membrane bound and has an acidic pH optimum. A hydrophobic region at the N terminus represents the signal peptide, and one near the C terminus that probably represents the transmembrane anchor. A regulatory domain within the protein has been identified as a β-sandwich, comprising 7 strands in 2 sheets in a greek-key topology. Some family members have an additional 1-2 strands to the common fold [[cite:PUB00010644]].</p>  <p>The bacterial and archaeal sequences having this signature are variously annotated, examples are:</p>  <ul> <li>Hypothetical/conserved/membrane/cell surface protein</li> <li>N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase</li> <li>Side tail fibre protein homologue from lambdoid prophage Rac</li> <li>Hypothetical tonB-linked outer membrane receptor</li> <li>OmpA-related protein</li> <li>Putative outer membrane protein, probably involved in nutrient binding</li> <li>TonB-dependent receptor</li> </ul>  <p>This entry also includes the teneurin family members, which may function as cellular signal transducers.</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR008984	SMAD/FHA domain superfamily	<p>FHA and SMAD (MH2) domains share a common structure consisting of a sandwich of eleven β-strands in two sheets with Greek key topology. Forkhead-associated (FHA) domains were originally identified as a sequence profile of about 75 amino acids, whereas the full-length domain is closer to about 150 amino acids. FHA domains are found in transcription factors, kinesin motors, and in a variety of other signalling molecules in organisms ranging from eubacteria to humans. FHA domains are protein-protein interaction domains that are specific for phosphoproteins. FHA-containing proteins function in maintaining cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. FHA domain proteins include the Chk2/Rad53/Cds1 family of proteins that contain one or more FHA domains, as well as a Ser/Thr kinase domain [[cite:PUB00010677], [cite:PUB00010678], [cite:PUB00010679]].</p>  <p>SMAD (Mothers against decapentaplegic (MAD) homologue) domain proteins are found in a range of species from nematodes to humans. These highly conserved proteins contain an N-terminal MH1 domain that contacts DNA, and is separated by a short linker region from the C-terminal MH2 domain, the later showing a striking similarity to FHA domains. SMAD proteins mediate signalling by the TGF-beta/activin/BMP-2/4 cytokines from receptor Ser/Thr protein kinases at the cell surface to the nucleus. SMAD proteins fall into three functional classes: the receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs), including SMAD1, -2, -3, -5, and -8, each of which is involved in a ligand-specific signalling pathway [[cite:PUB00010680]]; the comediator SMADs (co-SMADs), including SMAD4, which interact with R-SMADs to participate in signalling [[cite:PUB00010681]]; and the inhibitory SMADs (I-SMADs), including SMAD6 and -7, which block the activation of R-SMADs and Co-SMADs, thereby negatively regulating signalling pathways [[cite:PUB00010682]].</p>  <p>Domains with this fold are also found as the transactivation domain of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which has a weak homology to SMAD domains [[cite:PUB00030421]], and the N-terminal domain of EssC protein in Staphylococcus aureus.</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036578	SMAD MH1 domain superfamily	<p>Smad proteins are signal transducers and transcriptional comodulators of the TGF-beta superfamily of ligands, which play a central role in regulating a broad range of cellular responses, including cell growth, differentiation, and specification of developmental fate, in diverse organisms from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. Ligand binding to specific transmembrane receptor kinases induces receptor oligomerisation and phosphorylation of the receptor specific Smad protein (R-Smad) in the cytoplasm. The R-Smad proteins regulate distinct signalling pathways. Smad1, 5 and 8 mediate the signals of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), while Smad2 and 3 mediate the signals of activins and TGF-betas. Upon ligand stimulation, R-Smad proteins are phosphorylated at the conserved C-terminal tail sequence, SS*xS* (where S* denotes a site of phosphorylation). The phosphorylated states of R-Smad proteins form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and are translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, the heteromeric complexes function as gene-specific transcription activators by binding to promoters and interacting with transcriptional coactivators. Smad6 and Smad7 are inhibitory Smad proteins that inhibit TGF-beta signalling by interfering with either receptor-mediated phosphorylation or hetero-oligomerisation between Smad4 and R-Smad proteins. Smad proteins comprise two conserved MAD homology domains, one in the N terminus (MH1) and one in the C terminus (MH2), separated by a more variable, proline-rich linker region. The MH1 domain has a role in DNA binding and negatively regulates the functions of MH2 domain, whereas the MH2 domain is responsible for transactivation and mediates phosphorylation-triggered heteromeric assembly between Smad4 and R-Smad [[cite:PUB00017053], [cite:PUB00010680]].</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR011992	EF-hand domain pair	<p>This domain superfamily consists of a duplication of two EF-hand units, where each unit is composed of two helices connected by a twelve-residue calcium-binding loop.  The calcium ion in the EF-hand loop is coordinated in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration. Many calcium-binding proteins contain an EF-hand type calcium-binding domain [[cite:PUB00014021], [cite:PUB00014022]]. These include:  calbindin D9K, S100 proteins such as calcyclin, polcalcin phl p 7 (a calcium-binding pollen allergen), osteonectin, parvalbumin, calmodulin [[cite:PUB00014032]] family of proteins (troponin C, caltractin, cdc4p, myosin essential chain, calcineurin, recoverin, neurocalcin), plasmodial-specific CaII-binding protein Cbp40, penta-EF-Hand proteins [[cite:PUB00014023]] (sorcin, grancalcin, calpain), as well as multidomain proteins such as phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, dystrophin, Cb1 and alpha-actinin. The fold consists of four helices and an open array of two hairpins.</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036860	SH2 domain superfamily	<p>The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain is a protein domain of about 100 amino-acid residues first identified as a conserved sequence region between the oncoproteins Src and Fps [[cite:PUB00003647]]. Similar sequences were later found in many other intracellular signal-transducing proteins [[cite:PUB00001638]]. SH2 domains function as regulatory modules of intracellular signalling cascades by interacting with high affinity to phosphotyrosine-containing target peptides in a sequence-specific, SH2 domains recognise between 3-6 residues C-terminal to the phosphorylated tyrosine in a fashion that differs from one SH2 domain to another, and strictly phosphorylation-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00003096], [cite:PUB00001025], [cite:PUB00005506], [cite:PUB00004203]]. They are found in a wide variety of protein contexts e.g., in association with catalytic domains of phospholipase Cy (PLCy) and the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases; within structural proteins such as fodrin and tensin; and in a group of small adaptor molecules, i.e Crk and Nck. The domains are frequently found as repeats in a single protein sequence and will then often bind both mono- and di-phosphorylated substrates.</p>  <p>The structure of the SH2 domain belongs to the α+β class, its overall shape forming a compact flattened hemisphere. The core structural elements comprise a central hydrophobic anti-parallel β-sheet, flanked by 2 short α-helices. The loop between strands 2 and 3 provides many of the binding interactions with the phosphate group of its phosphopeptide ligand, and is hence designated the phosphate binding loop, the phosphorylated ligand binds perpendicular to the β-sheet and typically interacts with the phosphate binding loop and a hydrophobic binding pocket that interacts with a pY+3 side chain. The N- and C-termini of the domain are close together in space and on the opposite face from the phosphopeptide binding surface and it has been speculated that this has facilitated their integration into surface-exposed regions of host proteins [[cite:PUB00007102]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR015988	STAT transcription factor, coiled coil	<p>The STAT protein (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) family contains transcription factors that are specifically activated to regulate gene transcription when cells encounter cytokines and growth factors, hence they act as signal transducers in the cytoplasm and transcription activators in the nucleus [[cite:PUB00007134]]. Binding of these factors to cell-surface receptors leads to receptor autophosphorylation at a tyrosine, the phosphotyrosine being recognised by the STAT SH2 domain, which mediates the recruitment of STAT proteins from the cytosol and their association with the activated receptor. The STAT proteins are then activated by phosphorylation via members of the JAK family of protein kinases, causing them to dimerise and translocated to the nucleus, where they bind to specific promoter sequences in target genes. In mammals, STATs comprise a family of seven structurally and functionally related proteins: Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5a and Stat5b, Stat6. STAT proteins play a critical role in regulating innate and acquired host immune responses. Dysregulation of at least two STAT signalling cascades (i.e. Stat3 and Stat5) is associated with cellular transformation.</p>  <p>Signalling through the JAK/STAT pathway is initiated when a cytokine binds to its corresponding receptor. This leads to conformational changes in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor, initiating activation of receptor associated members of the JAK family of kinases. The JAKs, in turn, mediate phosphorylation at the specific receptor tyrosine residues, which then serve as docking sites for STATs and other signalling molecules. Once recruited to the receptor, STATs also become phosphorylated by JAKs, on a single tyrosine residue. Activated STATs dissociate from the receptor, dimerise, translocate to the nucleus and bind to members of the GAS (gamma activated site) family of enhancers.</p>  <p>The seven STAT proteins identified in mammals range in size from 750 and 850 amino acids. The chromosomal distribution of these STATs, as well as the identification of STATs in more primitive eukaryotes, suggest that this family arose from a single primordial gene. STATs share 6 structurally and functionally conserved domains including: an N-terminal domain (ND) that strengthens interactions between STAT dimers on adjacent DNA-binding sites; a coiled-coil STAT domain (CCD) that is implicated in protein-protein interactions; a DNA-binding domain (DBD) with an immunoglobulin-like fold similar to p53 tumour suppressor protein; an EF-hand-like linker domain connecting the DNA-binding and SH2 domains; an SH2 domain ([interpro:IPR000980]) that acts as a phosphorylation-dependent switch to control receptor recognition and DNA-binding; and a C-terminal transactivation domain [[cite:PUB00011807], [cite:PUB00051157], [cite:PUB00032712]]. The crystal structure of the N terminus of Stat4 reveals a dimer. The interface of this dimer is formed by a ring-shaped element consisting of five short helices. Several studies suggest that this N-terminal dimerisation promotes cooperativity of binding to tandem GAS elements and with the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300.</p>	FALSE	FALSE

The N-terminal domain of STAT is responsible for protein interactions. This domain has a multi-helical structure assembled into a hook-like structure [[cite:PUB00005229]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR016024	Armadillo-type fold	<p>This entry represents a structural domain with an armadillo (ARM)-like fold, consisting of a multi-helical fold comprised of two curved layers of α-helices arranged in a regular right-handed superhelix, where the repeats that make up this structure are arranged about a common axis [[cite:PUB00015442]]. These superhelical structures present an extensive solvent-accessible surface that is well suited to binding large substrates such as proteins and nucleic acids.</p>  <p>The sequence similarity among these different repeats or domains is low, however they exhibit considerable structural similarity. Furthermore, the number of repeats present in the superhelical structure can vary between orthologues, indicating that rapid loss/gain of repeats has occurred frequently in evolution. A common phylogenetic origin has been proposed for the armadillo and HEAT repeats [[cite:PUB00015443]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036431	ARID DNA-binding domain superfamily	<p>The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) is an ~100-amino acid DNA-binding module found in a large number of eukaryotic transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and development [[cite:PUB00018453], [cite:PUB00018454]]. The ARID domain appears as a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains, such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger [[cite:PUB00018455]].</p>  <p>The basic structure of the ARID domain appears to be a series of six α-helices separated by β-strands, loops, or turns, but the structured region may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basic six. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into three structural classes:</p>  <ul><li>Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six α-helices;</li>  <li>ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal α-helix;</li>  <li>Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional α-helices at their N-and C-termini.</li></ul>  <p>Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs are restricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognising the duplex through insertion of a loop and an α-helix into the major groove and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacent sugar-phosphate backbone [[cite:PUB00018453], [cite:PUB00018454], [cite:PUB00018456]].</p>  <p>Some proteins known to contain an ARID domain are listed below:</p>  <ul><li>Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family.</li>  <li>Mammalian Bright, a B-cell-specific trans-activator of IgH transcription.</li>  <li>Mammalian PLU-1, a protein that is upregulated in breast cancer cells.</li>  <li>Mammalian RBP1 and RBP2, retinoblastoma-binding factors.</li>  <li>Mammalian Mrf-1 and Mrf-2, transcriptional modulators of the cytomegalovirus major intermediate-early promoter.</li>  <li>Drosophila melanogaster dead ringer protein, a transcriptional regulatory protein required for early embryonic development.</li>  <li>Yeast SWI1 protein, from the SWI/SNF complex involved in chromatin remodelling and broad aspects of transcription regulation.</li>  <li>Drosophila melanogaster Osa.

IPR036115	GCM domain superfamily	<p>GCM transcription factors are a family of proteins which contain a GCM motif. The GCM motif is a domain that has been identified in proteins belonging to a family of transcriptional regulators involved in fundamental developmental processes which comprise Drosophila melanogaster GCM and its mammalian homologues [[cite:PUB00007596], [cite:PUB00007597], [cite:PUB00007598], [cite:PUB00007599]]. In GCM transcription factors the N-terminal moiety contains a DNA-binding domain of 150 residues. Sequence conservation is highest in this GCM domain. In contrast, the C-terminal moiety contains one or two transactivating regions and is only poorly conserved.</p>  <p>The GCM motif has been shown to be a DNA binding domain that recognises preferentially the nonpalindromic octamer 5'-ATGCGGGT-3' [[cite:PUB00007596], [cite:PUB00007597], [cite:PUB00007598]]. The GCM motif contains many conserved basic amino acid residues, seven cysteine residues, and four histidine residues [[cite:PUB00007596]]. The conserved cysteines are involved in shaping the overall conformation of the domain, in the process of DNA binding and in the redox regulation of DNA binding [[cite:PUB00007598]]. The GCM domain is a new class of Zn-containing DNA-binding domain with no similarity to any other DNA-binding domain [[cite:PUB00011125]]. The GCM domain consists of a large and a small domain tethered together by one of the two Zn ions present in the structure. The large and the small domains comprise five-and three-stranded β-sheets, respectively, with three small helical segments packed against the same side of the two β-sheets. The GCM domain exercises a novel mode of sequence-specific DNA recognition, where the five-stranded β-pleated sheet inserts into the major groove of the DNA. Residues protruding from the edge strand of the β-pleated sheet and the following loop and strand contact the bases and backbone of both DNA strands, providing specificity for its DNA target site.</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR034882	CENP-B, dimerisation domain superfamily	<p>Centromere protein B (CENP-B) interacts with centromeric heterochromatin in chromosomes and binds to a specific subset of alphoid satellite DNA, called the CENP-B box. CENP-B may organise arrays of centromere satellite DNA into a higher order structure, which then directs centromere formation and kinetochore assembly in mammalian chromosomes.</p> <p>The CENP-B dimerisation domain is composed of two α-helices, which are folded into an antiparallel configuration. Dimerisation of CENP-B is mediated by this domain, in which monomers dimerise to form a symmetrical, antiparallel, four-helix bundle structure with a large hydrophobic patch in which 23 residues of one monomer form van der Waals contacts with the other monomer. This CENP-B dimer configuration may be suitable for capturing two distant CENP-B boxes during centromeric heterochromatin formation [[cite:PUB00031759]].</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR029071	Ubiquitin-like domain superfamily	<p>Ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like proteins are typified by a β-grasp fold. Ub-like proteins (Ubl) such as Nedd8 [[cite:PUB00069793]] and SUMO [[cite:PUB00053766]] are also covalently linked to target polypeptides, just as Ub itself.

IPR036443	Zinc finger, RanBP2-type superfamily	<p>Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates [[cite:PUB00035807], [cite:PUB00035805], [cite:PUB00035806], [cite:PUB00035804], [cite:PUB00014077]]. Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and of the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. There are many superfamilies of Znf motifs, varying in both sequence and structure. They display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g. some bind DNA, others protein), suggesting that Znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. For example, Znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeleton organisation, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodelling and zinc sensing, to name but a few [[cite:PUB00035812]]. Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target.</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR009061	Putative DNA-binding domain superfamily	"<p>A putative DNA-binding domain with a conserved structure is found in several different protein families. The core structure of the domain consists of a three-helical fold that is architecturally similar to that of the ""winged-helix"" fold, but is topologically distinct.

IPR036020	WW domain superfamily	<p>The WW domain is a short conserved region in a number of unrelated proteins, which folds as a stable, triple stranded β-sheet.

The name WW or WWP derives from the presence of two signature tryptophan residues that are spaced 20-23 amino acids apart and are present in most WW domains known to date, as well as that of a conserved Pro. The WW domain binds to proteins with particular proline-motifs, [AP]-P-P-[AP]-Y, and/or phosphoserine- phosphothreonine-containing motifs [[cite:PUB00004872], [cite:PUB00007124]].

IPR036361	SAP domain superfamily	<p>The SAP motif is a 35-residue motif, which has been named after SAF-A/B, Acinus and PIAS, three proteins known to contain it.

The tail of T. brucei 6PGDH is shorter than that of the mammalian enzyme and its terminal residues associate tightly with the second monomer. The three-dimensional structure shows this generates additional interactions between the subunits close to the active site; the coenzyme-binding domain is thereby associated more tightly with the helical domain. Three residues, conserved in all other known sequences, are important in creating a salt bridge between monomers close to the substrate-binding site [[cite:PUB00010616]].</p> <p>This domain is structurally similar to domains found in several different families, including those represented by mannitol 2-dehydrogenase, acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase, short chain L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, UDP-glucose/GDP-mannose dehydrogenase (dimerisation domain), N-(1-D-carboxylethyl)-L-norvaline dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and ketopantoate reductase (PanE).</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR037213	RUN domain superfamily	<p>The RUN domain, named after RPIP8, unc-14 and NESCA, is organised into six conserved blocks (A-F), which constitute the 'core' of a globular structure tolerating insertions of considerable length between the conserved blocks [[cite:PUB00102668]]. The RUN domain is found in one or two copies in several proteins that are linked particularly to the functions of GTPases in the Rap and Rab families. This domain is thought to be a specific effector of small GTPases, but in the case of many of RUN domains their specific partners and their roles need to be determined. RUN domains can be associated with TBC/rab GAP, FYVE, DENN, SH3, DAG/PE-binding, PLAT/LH2, PH or PX domains. The RUN domain may have a role in the interaction of various proteins with cytoskeletal filaments [[cite:PUB00018297]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR035969	Rab-GAP-TBC domain superfamily	<p>The ~200 amino acid TBC/rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain is well conserved across species and has been found in a wide range of different proteins from plant adhesion molecules to mammalian oncogenes. The name TBC derives from the name of the murine protein Tbc1 in which this domain was first identified based on its similarity to sequences in the tre-2 oncogene, and the yeast regulators of mitosis, BUB2 and cdc16 [[cite:PUB00004496]]. The connection of this domain with rab GTPase activation stems from subsequent in-depth sequence analyses and alignments [[cite:PUB00005468]] and recent work demonstrating that it appears to contain the catalytic activities of the yeast rab GAPs, GYP1, and GYP7 [[cite:PUB00018101]].</p>  <p>The TBC/rab GAP domain has also been named PTM after three proteins known to contain it: the Drosophila pollux, the human oncoprotein TRE17 (oncoTRE17), and a myeloid cell line-expressed protein [[cite:PUB00018102]]. The TBC/rab GAP domain contains six conserved motifs named A to F [[cite:PUB00005468]]. A conserved arginine residue in the sequence motif B has been shown to be critical for the full GAP activity [[cite:PUB00018101]]. Resolution of the 3D structure of the TBC/rab GAP domain of GYP1 has shown that it is a fully α-helical V-shaped molecule. The conserved arginine residue is positioned at the side of the narrow cleft on the concave site of the V-shaped molecule. It has been proposed that this cleft is the binding site for the GTPase. The conserved arginine residue probably functions as a catalytic arginine finger analogous to that seen in ras and Rho-GAPs. The two key features of the arginine finger activation mechanism appear to be (i) the positioning of the catalytically essential GTPase glutamine side chain via a hydrogen bonding interaction between the glutamine carbamoyl-NH2 group and the main chain carbonyl group of the GAP arginine, and (ii) the polarization of the gamma-phosphate group or the stabilization of charge on it via the interaction of the positively charged side chain guanidinoyl group of the GAP arginine [[cite:PUB00014098]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036855	Zinc finger, CCCH-type superfamily	<p>Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates [[cite:PUB00035807], [cite:PUB00035805], [cite:PUB00035806], [cite:PUB00035804], [cite:PUB00014077]]. Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and of the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. There are many superfamilies of Znf motifs, varying in both sequence and structure. They display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g. some bind DNA, others protein), suggesting that Znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. For example, Znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeleton organisation, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodelling and zinc sensing, to name but a few [[cite:PUB00035812]]. Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target.</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR015947	PUA-like superfamily	<p>This superfamily represents domains with a PUA-like structure, consisting of a pseudo-barrel composed of mixed folded sheets of five strands. This structural motif is found in:</p>  <ul><li>PUA-containing proteins.</li> <li>The N-terminal of ATP sulphurylases, which contains extra structures, some similar to the PK β-barrel domain [[cite:PUB00014132]].</li> <li>Several bacterial hypothetical proteins, such as the N-terminal domain of YggJ [[cite:PUB00029267]].</li></ul>  <p>The PUA (PseudoUridine synthase and Archaeosine transglycosylase) domain was named after the proteins in which it was first found [[cite:PUB00003444]]. PUA is a highly conserved RNA-binding motif found in a wide range of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic proteins, including enzymes that catalyse tRNA and rRNA post-transcriptional modifications, proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation, as well as in enzymes involved in proline biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00036064], [cite:PUB00036065]]. The structures of several PUA-RNA complexes reveal a common RNA recognition surface, but also some versatility in the way in which the motif binds to RNA [[cite:PUB00036063]]. PUA motifs are involved in dyskeratosis congenita and cancer, pointing to links between RNA metabolism and human diseases [[cite:PUB00036066]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR038765	Papain-like cysteine peptidase superfamily	<p>This entry represents the papain-like cysteine peptidase superfamily. Its members typically consist of one α-helix and 4 strands of antiparallel β-sheet and contain the catalytic triad Cys-His-Asn.</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR008936	Rho GTPase activation protein	<p>Proteins containing a RhoGAP (Rho GTPase Activating Protein) domain usually function to catalyse the hydrolysis of GTP that is bound to Rho, Rac and/or Cdc42, inactivating these regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. The 53 known human RhoGAP domain-containing proteins are the largest known group of Rho GTPase regulators and significantly outnumber the 21 Rho GTPases they presumably regulate. This excess of GAP proteins probably indicates complex regulation of the Rho GTPases and is consistent with the existence of almost as many (48) human Dbl domain-containing Rho GEFs that act antagonistically to the RhoGAP proteins by activating the Rho GTPases. Phylogenetic analysis offers evidence for frequent domain duplication and for duplication of the entire genes containing these GAP domains [[cite:PUB00010623]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036517	FF domain superfamily	<p>This entry represents the FF domain superfamily.</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036792	Aspartate carbamoyltransferase regulatory subunit, C-terminal domain superfamily	<p>Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (aspartate transcarbamylase, ATCase) [ec:2.1.3.2] is an allosteric enzyme that plays a central role in the regulation of the pyrimidine pathway in bacteria. The holoenzyme is a dodecamer composed of six catalytic chains, each with an active site, and six regulatory chains lacking catalytic activity [[cite:PUB00014302]]. The catalytic subunits exist as a dimer of catalytic trimers, (c3)2, while the regulatory subunits exist as a trimer of regulatory dimers, (r2)3, therefore the complete holoenzyme can be represented as (c3)2(r2)3. The association of the catalytic subunits c3 with the regulatory subunits r2 is responsible for the establishment of positive co-operativity between catalytic sites for the binding of aspartate and it dictates the pattern of allosteric response toward nucleotide effectors. ATCase from Escherichia coli is the most extensively studied allosteric enzyme [[cite:PUB00006327]]. The crystal structure of the T-state, the T-state with CTP bound, the R-state with N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) bound, and the R-state with phosphonoacetamide plus malonate bound have been used in interpreting kinetic and mutational studies.</p>  <p>A high-resolution structure of E. coli ATCase in the presence of PALA (a bisubstrate analog) allows a detailed description of the binding at the active site of the enzyme and allows a detailed model of the tetrahedral intermediate to be constructed. The entire regulatory chain has been traced showing that the N-terminal regions of the regulatory chains R1 and R6 are located in close proximity to each other and to the regulatory site. This portion of the molecule may be involved in the observed asymmetry between the regulatory binding sites as well as in the heterotropic response of the enzyme [[cite:PUB00006470]]. The C-terminal domain of the regulatory chains have a rubredoxin-like zinc-bound fold.</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036005	Creatinase/aminopeptidase-like	"<p>This entry contains proteins that belong to MEROPS peptidase family M24 (clan MG), which share a common structural-fold, the ""pita-bread"" fold. The fold contains both α helices and an anti-parallel β sheet within two structurally similar domains that are thought to be derived from an ancient gene duplication. The active site, where conserved, is located between the two domains. The fold is common to methionine aminopeptidase ([ec:3.4.11.18]), aminopeptidase P ([ec:3.4.11.9]), prolidase ([ec:3.4.13.9]), agropine synthase and creatinase ([ec:3.5.3.3]). Though many of these peptidases require a divalent cation, creatinase is not a metal-dependent enzyme [[cite:PUB00044073], [cite:PUB00026792], [cite:PUB00000379]].</p>"	FALSE	FALSE
IPR016197	Chromo-like domain superfamily	<p>This entry represents a chromo (CHRromatin Organization MOdifier) structural domain, which consists of an SH3-like β-barrel capped by a C-terminal helix. Chromo domains are conserved modules of around 60 amino acids that are implicated in the recognition of lysine-methylated histone tails and nucleic acids. Chromo domains were originally identified in Drosophila modifiers of variegation, proteins that alter the structure of chromatin to the condensed morphology of heterochromatin. Domains with a chromo domain structural fold include:</p>  <ul> <li>Chromo domain, which lacks the first strand of the SH3-like β-barrel.</li> <li>Shadow chromo domain, in which the first strand of the SH3-like β-barrel is altered by insertions.</li> <li>Chromo barrel domain, which is a typical SH3-like β-barrel fold (similar sequence motif to the canonical chromo domain).</li> <li>Histone-like DNA-binding proteins from Archaea [[cite:PUB00023596]].</li> </ul>  <p>Chromo domains can be found in various nuclear proteins, including heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (N-terminal chromo domain and C-terminal chromo shadow domain), where the chromo domain recognises histone tails with specifically methylated lysines [[cite:PUB00026774]]; polycomb protein Pc, which is essential for maintaining the silencing state of homeotic genes during development (chromo domain important for chromatin targeting) [[cite:PUB00029833]]; histone methyltransferase clr4, which regulates silencing and switching at the mating-type loci and to affect chromatin structure at centromeres [[cite:PUB00028545]]; and the ATP-dependent helicase CHD1, which regulates ATP-dependent nucleosome assembly and mobilisation through conserved double chromo domains and a SWI2/SNF2 helicase/ATPase domain [[cite:PUB00039496]].</p>  <p>Chromo barrel domains are found in various histone acetyltransferases, such as MYST1 from Mus musculus (Mouse) and MOF from Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly) [[cite:PUB00039764]]. This domain can also be found in the human mortality factor 4-like protein, MRG15.</p>	FALSE	TRUE
IPR012674	Calycin	<p>Calycins form a large protein superfamily that share similar β-barrel structures. Calycins can be divided into families that include lipocalins, fatty acid binding proteins, triabin, and thrombin inhibitor [[cite:PUB00014136]]. Of these families, the lipocalin family ([interpro:IPR002345]) is the largest and functionally the most diverse. Lipocalins are extracellular proteins that share several common recognition properties such as ligand binding, receptor binding and the formation of complexes with other macromolecules. Lipocalins include the retinol binding protein, lipocalin allergen, aphrodisin (a sex hormone), alpha-2U-globulin, prostaglandin D synthase, beta-lactoglobulin, bilin-binding protein, and the nitrophorins [[cite:PUB00014141], [cite:PUB00014138], [cite:PUB00014139], [cite:PUB00014140]]. Bacterial hypothetical proteins YodA from Escherichia coli and YwiB from Bacillus subtilis share a similar calycin β-barrel structure. Part of the YodA hypothetical protein has a calycin-like structure [[cite:PUB00015733]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR008981	F-MuLV receptor-binding	<p>The F-MuLV receptor-binding domain forms part of the retroviral envelope glycoprotein in the murine leukaemia virus.  Envelope glycoproteins are synthesized as single chain precursors, which are subsequently cleaved into the surface subunit (SU) and the transmembrane subunit TM.  The N-terminal half of SU forms the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for binding to the cell surface receptor, the cationic amino acid transporter mCAT-1.  The RBD is structurally partitioned into a conserved β sandwich framework of Greek key topology and a variable helical loop subdomain [[cite:PUB00010668]].  The RBD contains three variable regions, VRA, VRB and VRC, which vary in sequence and length between MuLVs that use different receptors.  VRA and VRB are closely associated with one another in the helical subdomain.  There is a putative receptor-binding pocket in VRA, which may play a role in helping to determine receptor specificity [[cite:PUB00010669]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR025659	Tubby-like, C-terminal	<p>Tubby, an autosomal recessive mutation, mapping to mouse chromosome 7, was recently found to be the result of a splicing defect in a novel gene with unknown function. This mutation maps to the tub gene [[cite:PUB00000932], [cite:PUB00004232]]. The mouse tubby mutation is the cause of maturity-onset obesity, insulin resistance and sensory deficits. By contrast with the rapid juvenile-onset weight gain seen in diabetes (db) and obese (ob) mice, obesity in tubby mice develops gradually, and strongly resembles the late-onset obesity observed in the human population. Excessive deposition of adipose tissue culminates in a two-fold increase of body weight. Tubby mice also suffer retinal degeneration and neurosensory hearing loss. The tripartite character of the tubby phenotype is highly similar to human obesity syndromes, such as Alstrom and Bardet-Biedl. Although these phenotypes indicate a vital role for tubby proteins, no biochemical function has yet been ascribed to any family member [[cite:PUB00007281]], although it has been suggested that the phenotypic features of tubby mice may be the result of cellular apoptosis triggered by expression of the mutated tub gene. TUB is the founding-member of the tubby-like proteins, the TULPs. TULPs are found in multicellular organisms from both the plant and animal kingdoms. Ablation of members of this protein family cause disease phenotypes that are indicative of their importance in nervous-system function and development [[cite:PUB00014197]].</p>  <p>Mammalian TUB is a hydrophilic protein of ~500 residues. The N-terminal ([interpro:IPR005398]) portion of the protein is conserved neither in length nor sequence, but, in TUB, contains the nuclear localisation signal and may have transcriptional-activation activity. The C-terminal 250 residues are highly conserved. The C-terminal extremity contains a cysteine residue that might play an important role in the normal functioning of these proteins. The crystal structure of the C-terminal core domain from mouse tubby has been determined to 1.9A resolution. This domain is arranged as a 12-stranded, all anti-parallel, closed β-barrel that surrounds a central α helix, (which is at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the protein) that forms most of the hydrophobic core. Structural analyses suggest that TULPs constitute a unique family of bipartite transcription factors [[cite:PUB00007281]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036850	Nucleoside diphosphate kinase-like domain superfamily	<p>Nucleoside diphosphate kinases ([ec:2.7.4.6]) (NDK) are enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) other than ATP. They provide NTPs for nucleic acid synthesis, CTP for lipid synthesis, UTP for polysaccharide synthesis and GTP for protein elongation, signal transduction and microtubule polymerisation.</p>  <p>NDK are proteins of 17 Kd that act via a ping-pong mechanism in which a histidine residue is phosphorylated, by transfer of the terminal phosphate group from ATP. In the presence of magnesium, the phosphoenzyme can transfer its phosphate group to any NDP, to produce an NTP.</p>  <p>NDK isozymes have been sequenced from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources. It has also been shown [[cite:PUB00000847]] that the Drosophila awd (abnormal wing discs) protein, is a microtubule-associated NDK. Mammalian NDK is also known as metastasis inhibition factor nm23. The sequence of NDK has been highly conserved through evolution. There is a single histidine residue conserved in all known NDK isozymes, which is involved in the catalytic mechanism [[cite:PUB00002696]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
