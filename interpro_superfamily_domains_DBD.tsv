IPR009057	Homeobox-like domain superfamily	"<p>Homeobox domain (also known as homeodomain) proteins are transcription factors that share a related DNA binding homeodomain [[cite:PUB00013192]]. The homeodomain was first identified in a number of Drosophila homeotic and segmentation proteins, but is now known to be well conserved in many other animals, including vertebrates. The domain binds DNA through a helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure. The HTH motif is characterised by two α-helices, which make intimate contacts with the DNA and are joined by a short turn. The second helix binds to DNA via a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which occur between specific side chains and the exposed bases and thymine methyl groups within the major groove of the DNA. The first helix helps to stabilise the structure. Many proteins contain homeodomains, including Drosophila Engrailed, yeast mating type proteins, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a and HOX proteins.</p>
<p>The homeodomain motif is very similar in sequence and structure to domains in a wide range of DNA-binding proteins, including recombinases, Myb proteins, GARP response regulators, human telomeric proteins (hTRF1), paired domain proteins (PAX), yeast RAP1, centromere-binding proteins CENP-B and ABP-1, transcriptional regulators (TyrR), AraC-type transcriptional activators, and tetracycline repressor-like proteins (TetR, QacR, YcdC) [[cite:PUB00013193], [cite:PUB00013194], [cite:PUB00003347]].</p>"	TRUE	FALSE
IPR036236	Zinc finger C2H2 superfamily	<p>C2H2-type (classical) zinc fingers (ZnF) were the first class to be characterised. They contain a short β-hairpin and an α-helix (β/β/α structure), where a single zinc atom is held in place by Cys(2)His(2) (C2H2) residues in a tetrahedral array. C2H2 ZnF's can be divided into three groups based on the number and pattern of fingers: triple-C2H2 (binds single ligand), multiple-adjacent-C2H2 (binds multiple ligands), and separated paired-C2H2 [[cite:PUB00035808]]. C2H2 ZnF's are the most common DNA-binding motifs found in eukaryotic transcription factors, and have also been identified in prokaryotes [[cite:PUB00035809]].  Transcription factors usually contain several Zn'Fs (each with a conserved β/β/α structure) capable of making multiple contacts along the DNA, where the C2H2 ZnF motifs recognise DNA sequences by binding to the major groove of DNA via a short α-helix in the ZnF, the ZnF spanning 3-4 bases of the DNA [[cite:PUB00035811]]. C2H2 ZnF's can also bind to RNA and protein targets [[cite:PUB00043274]].</p> <p>Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates [[cite:PUB00035807], [cite:PUB00035805], [cite:PUB00035806], [cite:PUB00035804], [cite:PUB00014077]]. Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and of the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. There are many superfamilies of Znf motifs, varying in both sequence and structure. They display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g. some bind DNA, others protein), suggesting that Znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. For example, Znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeleton organisation, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodelling and zinc sensing, to name but a few [[cite:PUB00035812]].  Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target.</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR036638	Helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain superfamily	"<p>This domain is found in a number of eukaryotic proteins, which probably are sequence specific DNA-binding proteins that act as transcription factors, share a conserved domain of 40 to 50 amino acid residues. It has been proposed [[cite:PUB00000825]] that this domain is formed of two amphipathic helices joined by a variable length linker region that could form a loop. This 'helix-loop-helix' (HLH) domain mediates protein dimerisation and has been found in the proteins listed below [[cite:PUB00001514]]. Most of these proteins have an extra basic region of about 15 amino acid residues that is adjacent to the HLH domain and specifically binds to DNA. They are referred as basic helix-loop-helix proteins (bHLH), and are classified in two groups: class A (ubiquitous) and class B (tissue-specific). Members of the bHLH family bind variations on the core sequence 'CANNTG', also referred to as
the E-box motif. The homo- or heterodimerisation mediated by the HLH domain is independent of, but necessary for DNA binding, as two basic regions are required for DNA binding activity. The HLH proteins lacking the basic domain (Emc, Id) function as negative regulators, since they form heterodimers, but fail to bind DNA. The hairy-related proteins (hairy, E(spl), deadpan) also repress transcription although they can bind DNA. The proteins of this subfamily act together with co-repressor proteins, like groucho, through their -terminal motif WRPW.</p>"	TRUE	FALSE
IPR035965	PAS domain superfamily	"<p>PAS domains are involved in many signalling proteins where they are used as a signal sensor domain [[cite:PUB00015791]]. PAS domains appear in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. Several PAS-domain proteins are known to detect their signal by way of an associated cofactor. Heme,
flavin, and a 4-hydroxycinnamyl chromophore are used in different proteins. The PAS domain was named after three proteins that it occurs in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per- period circadian protein</li>
<li>Arnt- Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein</li>
<li>Sim-  single-minded protein.</li>
</ul>
<p>PAS domains are often associated with PAC domains [interpro:IPR001610].  It appears that these domains are directly linked, and that together they form the conserved 3D PAS fold.  The division between the PAS and PAC domains is caused by major differences in sequences in the region connecting these two motifs [[cite:PUB00014500]].  In human PAS kinase, this region has been shown to be very flexible, and adopts different conformations depending on the bound ligand [[cite:PUB00014501]]. Probably the most surprising identification of a PAS domain was that in EAG-like K<sup></sup>-channels [[cite:PUB00005472]].</p>"	FALSE	FALSE
IPR011011	Zinc finger, FYVE/PHD-type	"<p>The FYVE zinc finger domain is conserved from yeast to man, and is named after four proteins that it has been found in: Fab1, YOTB/ZK632.12, Vac1, and EEA1. It functions in the membrane recruitment of cytosolic proteins by binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), which is found mainly on endosomes [[cite:PUB00014078], [cite:PUB00014077]].</p>

<p>The plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger domain has a C4HC3-type motif, and is widely distributed in eukaryotes, being found in many chromatin regulatory factors [[cite:PUB00014079]].</p>

<p>Both the FYVE and the PHD zinc finger motifs display strikingly similar dimetal(zinc)-bound α+β folds.</p> <p>Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates [[cite:PUB00035807], [cite:PUB00035805], [cite:PUB00035806], [cite:PUB00035804], [cite:PUB00014077]].

IPR010919	SAND-like domain superfamily	"<p>The SAND domain (named after Sp100, AIRE-1, NucP41/75, DEAF-1) is a conserved ~80 residue region found in a number of nuclear proteins, many of which function in chromatin-dependent transcriptional control. These include proteins linked to various human diseases, such as the Sp100 (Speckled protein 100kDa), NUDR (Nuclear DEAF-1 related), GMEB (Glucocorticoid Modulatory Element Binding) proteins and AIRE-1 (Autoimmune regulator 1) proteins.</p>

<p>Proteins containing the SAND domain have a modular structure; the SAND domain can be associated with a number of other modules, including the bromodomain, the PHD finger and the MYND finger. Because no SAND domain has been found in yeast, it is thought that the SAND domain could be restricted to animal phyla. Many SAND domain-containing proteins, including NUDR, DEAF-1 (Deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1) and GMEB, have been shown to bind DNA sequences specifically. The SAND domain has been proposed to mediate the DNA binding activity of these proteins [[cite:PUB00005483], [cite:PUB00007101]]. Structurally, the SAND domain consists of a novel α/β fold, which has a core of three short helices packed against a barrel-like β-sheet; it is structurally similar to the SH3-like fold.</p>

<p>Other proteins display domains that are structurally similar to the SAND domain. One such example is the SMAD4-binding domain of the oncoprotein Ski, which is stabilised by a bound zinc atom, and resembles a SAND domain, in which the corresponding I loop is responsible for DNA binding. Ski is able to disrupt the formation of a functional complex between the Co- and R-SMADs, leading to the repression of TGF-beta, Activin and BMP responses, resulting in the repression of TGF-signalling [[cite:PUB00013959]].</p>"	FALSE	FALSE
IPR035500	Nuclear hormone receptor-like domain superfamily	"<p>Steroid or nuclear hormone receptors constitute an important superfamily of transcription regulators that are involved in widely diverse physiological functions, including control of embryonic development, cell differentiation and homeostasis. The receptors function as dimeric molecules in nuclei to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner. Nuclear hormone receptors consist of a highly conserved DNA-binding domain that recognises specific sequences ([interpro:IPR001628]), connected via a linker region to a C-terminal ligand-binding domain. In addition, certain nuclear hormone receptors have an N-terminal modulatory domain ([interpro:IPR046944]). The ligand-binding domain acts in response to ligand binding, which caused a conformational change in the receptor to induce a response, thereby acting as a molecular switch to turn on transcriptional activity [[cite:PUB00016720]]. For example, after binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to the corticosteroid ligand, the receptor is induced to perform functions ranging from nuclear translocation, oligomerization, cofactor/kinase/transcription factor association, and DNA binding [[cite:PUB00016721]]. The ligand-binding domain is a flexible unit, where the binding of a ligand stabilises its conformation, which in turn favours coactivator binding to modify receptor activity [[cite:PUB00016722]]; the coactivator can bind to the activator function 2 (AF2) site at the C-terminal end of the ligand-binding domain [[cite:PUB00016725]]. The binding of different ligands can alter the conformation of the ligand-binding domain, which ultimately affects the DNA-binding specificity of the DNA-binding domain. In the absence of ligand, steroid hormone receptors are thought to be weakly associated with nuclear components.</p>

IPR036431	ARID DNA-binding domain superfamily	"<p>The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) is an ~100-amino acid DNA-binding module found in a large number of eukaryotic transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and development [[cite:PUB00018453], [cite:PUB00018454]]. The ARID domain appears as a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains, such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger [[cite:PUB00018455]].</p>

<p>The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of six α-helices separated by β-strands, loops, or turns, but the structured region may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basic six. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into three structural classes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six α-helices;</li>

<li>ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal α-helix;</li>

<li>Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional α-helices at their N-and C-termini.</li>

</ul>

<p>Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs are restricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognising the duplex through insertion of a loop and an α-helix into the major groove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacent sugar-phosphate backbone [[cite:PUB00018453], [cite:PUB00018454], [cite:PUB00018456]].</p>

<p>Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below:</p>

These superhelical structures present an extensive solvent-accessible surface that is well suited to binding large substrates such as proteins and nucleic acids.</p>

<p>The sequence similarity among these different repeats or domains is low, however they exhibit considerable structural similarity. Furthermore, the number of repeats present in the superhelical structure can vary between orthologues, indicating that rapid loss/gain of repeats has occurred frequently in evolution.

IPR016197	Chromo-like domain superfamily	"<p>This entry represents a chromo (CHRromatin Organization MOdifier) structural domain, which consists of an SH3-like β-barrel capped by a C-terminal helix. Chromo domains are conserved modules of around 60 amino acids that are implicated in the recognition of lysine-methylated histone tails and nucleic acids. Chromo domains were originally identified in Drosophila modifiers of variegation, proteins that alter the structure of chromatin to the condensed morphology of heterochromatin. Domains with a chromo domain structural fold include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chromo domain, which lacks the first strand of the SH3-like β-barrel.</li>
<li>Shadow chromo domain, in which the first strand of the SH3-like β-barrel is altered by insertions.</li>

Bromodomains are highly conserved α-helical motifs that can specifically interact with acetylated lysine residues on histone tails [[cite:PUB00005462], [cite:PUB00097275]]. In some proteins, the classical bromodomain has diverged to such an extent that parts of the region are either missing or contain an insertion (e.g., mammalian protein HRX, Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK783.4, yeast protein YTA7). The bromodomain may occur as a single copy, or in duplicate.</p>

In eukaryotic organisms, it appears in proteins with an important role in regulating chromatin-mediated gene transcriptional activation and silencing. In viruses,bacteria and archaea, its function is not clear yet [[cite:PUB00099756]].</p>

<p>This superfamily includes eukaryotic proteins with histone methyltransferase activity, which requires the combination of the SET domain with the adjacent cysteine-rich regions, one located N-terminally (pre-SET) and the other posterior to the SET domain (post-SET). Post- and pre- SET regions seem then to play a crucial role when it comes to substrate recognition and enzymatic activity [[cite:PUB00054125], [cite:PUB00007133]].

<p>The structure of the SET domain and the two adjacent regions pre-SET and post-SET have been solved [[cite:PUB00018235], [cite:PUB00018236], [cite:PUB00018237]]. The SET domain structure is all-β, but consists only in sets of few short strands composing no more than a couple of small sheets. Consequently the SET structure is mostly defined by turns and loops. An unusual feature is that the SET core is made up of two discontinuous segments of the primary sequence forming an approximate L-shape [[cite:PUB00005822], [cite:PUB00054125], [cite:PUB00007133]]. Two of the most conserved motifs in the SET domain are constituted by a stretch at the C-terminal containing a strictly conserved tyrosine residue and a preceding loop inside which the C-terminal segment passes forming a knot-like structure, but not quite a true knot.

This conformation allows dimerisation in parallel and it bends the helices so that the newly functional dimer forms a flexible fork where the basic domains, at the N-terminal open end, can then interact with DNA.

The Lambda C1 repressor consists of two domains connected by a linker: an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that also mediates interactions with RNA polymerase, and a C-terminal dimerisation domain [[cite:PUB00014015]]. The DNA-binding domain consists of four helices in a closed folded leaf motif. Several different phage repressors from different helix-turn-helix families contain DNA-binding domains that adopt a similar topology.

Sin3 proteins have at least three PAH domains (PAH1, PAH2, and PAH3) [[cite:PUB00066070], [cite:PUB00049433]]. They are components of a co-repressor complex that silences transcription, playing important roles in the transition between proliferation and differentiation. Sin3 proteins are recruited to the DNA by various DNA-binding transcription factors such as the Mad family of repressors, Mnt/Rox, PLZF, MeCP2, p53, REST/NRSF, MNFbeta, Sp1, TGIF and Ume6 [[cite:PUB00015086]].

The PAH domains are protein-protein interaction domains through which Sin3 fulfils its role as a scaffold. The PAH2 domain of Sin3 can interact with a wide range of unrelated and structurally diverse transcription factors that bind using different interaction motifs.

It is enriched in charged amino acids and can be divided into subregions A and B, which are predicted to fold into two amphipathic α-helices. The KRAB A and B boxes can be separated by variable spacer segments and many KRAB proteins contain only the A box [[cite:PUB00007161]].</p>

<p>The functions currently known for members of the KRAB-containing protein family include transcriptional repression of RNA polymerase I, II and III promoters, binding and splicing of RNA, and control of nucleolus function. The KRAB domain functions as a transcriptional repressor when tethered to the template DNA by a DNA-binding domain. A sequence of 45 amino acids in the KRAB A subdomain has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for transcriptional repression. The B box does not repress by itself but does potentiate the repression exerted by the KRAB A subdomain [[cite:PUB00007162], [cite:PUB00007163]]. Gene silencing requires the binding of the KRAB domain to the RING-B box-coiled coil (RBCC) domain of the KAP-1/TIF1-beta corepressor. As KAP-1 binds to the heterochromatin proteins HP1, it has been proposed that the KRAB-ZFP-bound target gene could be silenced following recruitment to heterochromatin [[cite:PUB00007164], [cite:PUB00007165]].</p>

<p>KRAB-ZFPs probably constitute the single largest class of transcription factors within the human genome [[cite:PUB00007166]]. The KRAB domain is generally encoded by two exons. The regions coded by the two exons are known as KRAB-A and KRAB-B. Although the function of KRAB-ZFPs is largely unknown, they appear to play important roles during cell differentiation and development. These proteins have been shown to play important roles in cell differentiation and organ development, and in regulating viral replication and transcription. A KRAB domain may consist of an A-box, or of an A-box plus either a B-box, a divergent B-box (b), or a C-box. Only the A-box is included in this model. The A-box is needed for repression, the B- and C- boxes are not. KRAB-ZFPs have one or two KRAB domains at their amino-terminal end, and multiple C2H2 zinc finger motifs at their C-termini. Some KRAB-ZFPs also contain a SCAN domain which mediates homo- and hetero-oligomerization. The KRAB domain is a protein-protein interaction module which represses transcription through recruiting corepressors. A key mechanism appears to be the following: KRAB-AFPs tethered to DNA recruit, via their KRAB domain, the repressor KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein-1, also known as transcription intermediary factor 1 beta, KRAB-A interacting protein and tripartite motif protein 28).

IPR036060	Zinc finger, C2H2C-type superfamily	"<p>Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates [[cite:PUB00035807], [cite:PUB00035805], [cite:PUB00035806], [cite:PUB00035804], [cite:PUB00014077]]. Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and of the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. There are many superfamilies of Znf motifs, varying in both sequence and structure. They display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g. some bind DNA, others protein), suggesting that Znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. For example, Znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeleton organisation, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodelling and zinc sensing, to name but a few [[cite:PUB00035812]].  Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target.</p> <p>This entry represents the CysCysHisHisCys (CCHHC) type zinc finger domain found in eukaryotes.  The CCHHC-type zinc finger contains five absolutely conserved cysteine and histidine residues (rather than the more usual four) with the sequence C-P-x-P-G-C-x-G-x-G-H-x(7)-H-R-x(4)-C. The second histidine has been shown to coordinate Zn(II) along with the three cysteines residues. The first His plays a different role in stabilizing the structure, stacking between the metal-binding core and an aromatic residue that is relatively conserved. CCHHC-type zinc fingers form small compact structures that can sit entirely within the major groove of DNA [[cite:PUB00048136], [cite:PUB00084246], [cite:PUB00084247], [cite:PUB00084248], [cite:PUB00030020]].</p>

IPR036879	Transcription factor, MADS-box superfamily	"<p>Human serum response factor (SRF) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein important for cell proliferation and differentiation. SRF function is essential for transcriptional regulation of numerous growth-factor-inducible genes, such as c-fos oncogene and muscle-specific actin genes.  A core domain of around 90 amino acids is sufficient for the activities of DNA-binding, dimerisation and interaction with accessory factors. Within the core is a DNA-binding region, designated the MADS box [[cite:PUB00004216]], that is highly similar to many eukaryotic regulatory proteins: among these are MCM1, the regulator of cell type-specific genes in fission yeast; DSRF, a Drosophila trachea development factor; the MEF2 family of myocyte-specific enhancer factors; and the Agamous and Deficiens families of plant homeotic proteins.</p>

<p>In SRF, the MADS box has been shown to be involved in DNA-binding and dimerisation [[cite:PUB00000821]]. Proteins belonging to the MADS family function as dimers, the primary DNA-binding element of which is an anti-parallel coiled coil of two amphipathic α-helices, one from each subunit. The DNA wraps around the coiled coil allowing the basic N-termini of the helices to fit into the DNA major groove. The chain extending from the helix N-termini reaches over the DNA backbone and penetrates into the minor groove. A 4-stranded, anti-parallel β-sheet packs against the coiled-coil face opposite the DNA and is the central element of the dimerisation interface.

The interlocking domain forms a 3-helical non-globular array that forms interlocked heterodimers with its target.</p>
<p>Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors involved in the regulation of many processes, including development, reproduction and homeostasis. Nuclear receptor coactivators act to modulate the function of nuclear receptors. Coactivators associate with promoters and enhancers primarily through protein-protein contacts to facilitate the interaction between DNA-bound transcription factors and the transcription machinery. Many of these coactivators are structurally related, including CBP (CREB-binding protein), P300 and ACTR (activator for thyroid and retinoid receptors) [[cite:PUB00013275]]. CBP and P300 both have histone acetyltransferase activity ([intenz:2.3.1.48]). CBP/P300 proteins function synergistically to activate transcription, acting to remodel chromatin and to recruit RNA polymerase II and the basal transcription machinery. CBP is required for proper cell cycle control, differentiation and apoptosis. The interaction of CBP/P300 with transcription factors involves several small domains. The IBiD domain in the C-terminal of CBP is responsible for CBP interaction with IRF-3, as well as with the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A, TIF-2 coactivator, and the IRF homologue KSHV IRF-1 [[cite:PUB00013276]].</p>
<p>Ncoa1, Ncoa2 and Ncoa3 are all coactivators of various nuclear receptors. In addition, Ncoa1 and Ncoa3 both have histone acetyltransferase activity, but Ncoa2 does not [[cite:PUB00029464], [cite:PUB00035991]].</p>"	FALSE	FALSE

Proteins containing this domain include the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p73, Fas, FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein), TNF-1 (tumour necrosis factor receptor-1), Pelle protein kinase, and the Tube adaptor protein [[cite:PUB00015057]].</p>
<p>The induction of apoptosis also relies on the presence of a second domain, called the death effector domain. The death effector domain (DED) occurs in proteins that regulate programmed cell death, including both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins; many of these proteins are also involved in controlling cellular activation and proliferation pathways [[cite:PUB00014108]]. Proteins containing this domain include FADD (DED N-terminal, DD C-terminal), PEA-15 (phosphoproteins enriched in astrocytes 15kDa), caspases and FLIP.</p>

<p>The induction of apoptosis results in the activation of caspases, a family of aspartyl-specific cysteine proteases that are the main executioners of apoptosis. For example, the DED of FADD recruits two DED-containing caspases, caspase-8 and caspase-10, to form the death-inducing signal complex, which initiates apoptosis. Proteins containing the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) are involved in the recruitment and activation of caspases during apoptosis [[cite:PUB00014109]]. Other CARD proteins participate in NF-kappaB signalling pathways associated with innate or adaptive immune responses. Proteins containing CARD include Raidd, APAF-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor 1), procaspase 9 and iceberg (inhibitor of interleukin-1-beta generation).</p>
<p>The DD shows strong structural similarity to both DED and CARD. They all display a 6-helical closed bundle fold, with greek key topology and an internal psuedo two-fold symmetry.

IPR036867	R3H domain superfamily	"<p>The R3H domain superfamily is a conserved sequence motif found in proteins from a diverse range of organisms including eubacteria, green plants, fungi and various groups of metazoans, but not in archaea and Escherichia coli. The domain is named R3H because it contains an invariant arginine and a highly conserved histidine, that are separated by three residues. It also displays a conserved pattern of hydrophobic residues, prolines and glycines. It can be found alone, in association with AAA domain or with various DNA/RNA binding domains like DSRM, KH, G-patch, PHD, DEAD box, or RRM. The functions of these domains indicate that the R3H domain might be involved in polynucleotide-binding, including DNA, RNA and single-stranded DNA [[cite:PUB00005485]].</p>

<p>The 3D structure of the R3H domain has been solved. The fold presents a small motif, consisting of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, against which two α-helices pack from one side. This fold is related to the structures of the YhhP protein and the C-terminal domain of the translational initiation factor IF3. Three conserved basic residues cluster on the same face of the R3H domain and could play a role in nucleic acid recognition.

<p>The SH3 domain has a characteristic fold which consists of five or six β-strands arranged as two tightly packed anti-parallel β-sheets. The linker regions may contain short helices. The surface of the SH3-domain bears a flat, hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket which consists of three shallow grooves defined by conservative aromatic residues in which the ligand adopts an extended left-handed helical arrangement. The ligand binds with low affinity but this may be enhanced by multiple interactions. The region bound by the SH3 domain is in all cases proline-rich and contains PXXP as a core-conserved binding motif. The function of the SH3 domain is not well understood but they may mediate many diverse processes such as increasing local concentration of proteins, altering their subcellular location and mediating the assembly of large multiprotein complexes [[cite:PUB00001031]].</p> <p>The crystal structure of the SH3 domain of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin, and the solution structures of SH3 domains of phospholipase C (PLC-y) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 alpha-subunit, have been determined [[cite:PUB00004135], [cite:PUB00000895], [cite:PUB00000887]]. In spite of relatively limited sequence similarity, their overall structures are similar. The domains belong to the α+β structural class, with five to eight β-strands forming 2 tightly-packed, anti-parallel β-sheets arranged in a barrel-like structure, and intervening loops sometimes forming helices. Conserved aliphatic and aromatic residues form a hydrophobic core (A11, L23, A29, V34, W42, L52 and V59 in PLC-y [[cite:PUB00000887]]) and a hydrophobic pocket on the molecular surface (L12, F13, W53 and P55 in PLC-y). The conserved core is believed to stabilise the fold, while the pocket is thought to serve as a binding site for target proteins. Conserved carboxylic amino acids located in the loops, on the periphery of the pocket (D14 and E22), may be involved in protein-protein interactions via proline-rich regions.

WD40 repeats usually assume a 7-8 bladed β-propeller fold, but proteins have been found with 4 to 16 repeated units, which also form a circularised β-propeller structure. WD-repeat proteins are a large family found in all eukaryotes and are implicated in a variety of functions ranging from signal transduction and transcription regulation to cell cycle control and apoptosis. Repeated WD40 motifs act as a site for protein-protein or protein-DNA  interaction, and proteins containing WD40 repeats are known to serve as platforms for the assembly of protein complexes or mediators of transient interplay among other proteins [[cite:PUB00094364]]. The specificity of the proteins is determined by the sequences outside the repeats themselves. Examples of such complexes are G proteins (beta subunit is a β-propeller), TAFII transcription factor, and E3 ubiquitin ligase [[cite:PUB00015237], [cite:PUB00005491]].

They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates [[cite:PUB00035807], [cite:PUB00035805], [cite:PUB00035806], [cite:PUB00035804], [cite:PUB00014077]].

IPR036578	SMAD MH1 domain superfamily	<p>Smad proteins are signal transducers and transcriptional comodulators of the TGF-beta superfamily of ligands, which play a central role in regulating a broad range of cellular responses, including cell growth, differentiation, and specification of developmental fate, in diverse organisms from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. Ligand binding to specific transmembrane receptor kinases induces receptor oligomerisation and phosphorylation of the receptor specific Smad protein (R-Smad) in the cytoplasm. The R-Smad proteins regulate distinct signalling pathways. Smad1, 5 and 8 mediate the signals of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), while Smad2 and 3 mediate the signals of activins and TGF-betas. Upon ligand stimulation, R-Smad proteins are phosphorylated at the conserved C-terminal tail sequence, SS*xS* (where S* denotes a site of phosphorylation). The phosphorylated states of R-Smad proteins form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and are translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, the heteromeric complexes function as gene-specific transcription activators by binding to promoters and interacting with transcriptional coactivators. Smad6 and Smad7 are inhibitory Smad proteins that inhibit TGF-beta signalling by interfering with either receptor-mediated phosphorylation or hetero-oligomerisation between Smad4 and R-Smad proteins. Smad proteins comprise two conserved MAD homology domains, one in the N terminus (MH1) and one in the C terminus (MH2), separated by a more variable, proline-rich linker region. The MH1 domain has a role in DNA binding and negatively regulates the functions of MH2 domain, whereas the MH2 domain is responsible for transactivation and mediates phosphorylation-triggered heteromeric assembly between Smad4 and R-Smad [[cite:PUB00017053], [cite:PUB00010680]].</p>	TRUE	FALSE

IPR015988	STAT transcription factor, coiled coil	"<p>The STAT protein (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) family contains transcription factors that are specifically activated to regulate gene transcription when cells encounter cytokines and growth factors, hence they act as signal transducers in the cytoplasm and transcription activators in the nucleus [[cite:PUB00007134]]. Binding of these factors to cell-surface receptors leads to receptor autophosphorylation at a tyrosine, the phosphotyrosine being recognised by the STAT SH2 domain, which mediates the recruitment of STAT proteins from the cytosol and their association with the activated receptor. The STAT proteins are then activated by phosphorylation via members of the JAK family of protein kinases, causing them to dimerise and translocated to the nucleus, where they bind to specific promoter sequences in target genes. In mammals, STATs comprise a family of seven structurally and functionally related proteins: Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5a and Stat5b, Stat6. STAT proteins play a critical role in regulating innate and acquired host immune responses. Dysregulation of at least two STAT signalling cascades (i.e. Stat3 and Stat5) is associated with cellular transformation.</p>

<p>Signalling through the JAK/STAT pathway is initiated when a cytokine binds to its corresponding receptor. This leads to conformational changes in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor, initiating activation of receptor associated members of the JAK family of kinases. The JAKs, in turn, mediate phosphorylation at the specific receptor tyrosine residues, which then serve as docking sites for STATs and other signalling molecules. Once recruited to the receptor, STATs also become phosphorylated by JAKs, on a single tyrosine residue. Activated STATs dissociate from the receptor, dimerise, translocate to the nucleus and bind to members of the GAS (gamma activated site) family of enhancers.</p>

<p>The seven STAT proteins identified in mammals range in size from 750 and 850 amino acids. The chromosomal distribution of these STATs, as well as the identification of STATs in more primitive eukaryotes, suggest that this family arose from a single primordial gene. STATs share 6 structurally and functionally conserved domains including: an N-terminal domain (ND) that strengthens interactions between STAT dimers on adjacent DNA-binding sites; a coiled-coil STAT domain (CCD) that is implicated in protein-protein interactions; a DNA-binding domain (DBD) with an immunoglobulin-like fold similar to p53 tumour suppressor protein; an EF-hand-like linker domain connecting the DNA-binding and SH2 domains; an SH2 domain ([interpro:IPR000980]) that acts as a phosphorylation-dependent switch to control receptor recognition and DNA-binding; and a C-terminal transactivation domain [[cite:PUB00011807], [cite:PUB00051157], [cite:PUB00032712]]. The crystal structure of the N terminus of Stat4 reveals a dimer. The interface of this dimer is formed by a ring-shaped element consisting of five short helices. Several studies suggest that this N-terminal dimerisation promotes cooperativity of binding to tandem GAS elements and with the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300.</p> <p>This entry represents a domain consisting of four long helices that forms a bundle with a left-handed twist (coiled coil), in a right-handed superhelix.</p>"	FALSE	FALSE

The domains are frequently found as repeats in a single protein sequence and will then often bind both mono- and di-phosphorylated substrates.</p>

<p>The structure of the SH2 domain belongs to the α+β class, its overall shape forming a compact flattened hemisphere. The core structural elements comprise a central hydrophobic anti-parallel β-sheet, flanked by 2 short α-helices. The loop between strands 2 and 3 provides many of the binding interactions with the phosphate group of its phosphopeptide ligand, and is hence designated the phosphate binding loop, the phosphorylated ligand binds perpendicular to the β-sheet and typically interacts with the phosphate binding loop and a hydrophobic binding pocket that interacts with a pY+3 side chain. The N- and C-termini of the domain are close together in space and on the opposite face from the phosphopeptide binding surface and it has been speculated that this has facilitated their integration into surface-exposed regions of host proteins [[cite:PUB00007102]].</p>"	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036741	TAFII-230 TBP-binding domain superfamily	<p>In eukaryotes, the general transcription factor TFIID helps to regulate transcription by RNA polymerase II from class II promoters. TFIID consists of TATA-box-binding proteins (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs), which together mediate both activation and inhibition of transcription. In Drosophila, the N-terminal region of TAFII-230 (the TFIID 230kDa subunit) binds directly to TBP, thereby inhibiting the binding of TBP to the TATA box. The N-terminal domain is comprised of three α helices and a β hairpin, which forms the core that occupies the DNA-binding surface of TBP [[cite:PUB00013214]].</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR011990	Tetratricopeptide-like helical domain superfamily	"<p>The domain represented in this superfamily consists of a multi-helical fold comprised of two curved layers of α-helices arranged in a regular right-handed superhelix, where the repeats that make up this structure are arranged about a common axis [[cite:PUB00015442]]. These superhelical structures present an extensive solvent-accessible surface that is well suited to binding large substrates such as proteins and nucleic acids. The TPR is likely to be an ancient repeat, since it is found in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea, whereas the PPR repeat is found predominantly in higher plants. The superhelix formed from these repeats can bind ligands at a number of different regions, and has the ability to acquire multiple functional roles [[cite:PUB00015443]].</p> <p>The tetratrico peptide repeat region (TPR) is a structural motif present in a wide range of proteins [[cite:PUB00005443], [cite:PUB00001313], [cite:PUB00005695]]. It mediates protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes [[cite:PUB00014195]]. The TPR motif consists of 3-16 tandem-repeats of 34 amino acids residues, although individual TPR motifs can be dispersed in the protein sequence. Sequence alignment of the TPR domains reveals a consensus sequence defined by a pattern of small and large amino acids. TPR motifs have been identified in various different organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. Proteins containing TPRs are involved in a variety of biological processes, such as cell cycle regulation, transcriptional control, mitochondrial and peroxisomal protein transport, neurogenesis and protein folding.</p>

<p>The X-ray structure of a domain containing three TPRs from protein phosphatase 5 revealed that TPR adopts a helix-turn-helix arrangement, with adjacent TPR motifs packing in a parallel fashion, resulting in a spiral of repeating anti-parallel α-helices [[cite:PUB00014195]]. The two helices are denoted helix A and helix B. The packing angle between helix A and helix B is ~24 degrees within a single TPR and generates a right-handed superhelical shape. Helix A interacts with helix B and with helix A' of the next TPR. Two protein surfaces are generated: the inner concave surface is contributed to mainly by residue on helices A, and the other surface presents residues from both helices A and B.</p>"	FALSE	FALSE
IPR012674	Calycin	<p>Calycins form a large protein superfamily that share similar β-barrel structures. Calycins can be divided into families that include lipocalins, fatty acid binding proteins, triabin, and thrombin inhibitor [[cite:PUB00014136]]. Of these families, the lipocalin family ([interpro:IPR002345]) is the largest and functionally the most diverse. Lipocalins are extracellular proteins that share several common recognition properties such as ligand binding, receptor binding and the formation of complexes with other macromolecules. Lipocalins include the retinol binding protein, lipocalin allergen, aphrodisin (a sex hormone), alpha-2U-globulin, prostaglandin D synthase, beta-lactoglobulin, bilin-binding protein, and the nitrophorins [[cite:PUB00014141], [cite:PUB00014138], [cite:PUB00014139], [cite:PUB00014140]]. Bacterial hypothetical proteins YodA from Escherichia coli and YwiB from Bacillus subtilis share a similar calycin β-barrel structure. Part of the YodA hypothetical protein has a calycin-like structure [[cite:PUB00015733]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036674	p53-like tetramerisation domain superfamily	<p>The p53 protein is a tetrameric transcription factor that plays a central role in the prevention of neoplastic transformation [[cite:PUB00014036]]. Oligomerization appears to be essential for the tumour suppressing activity of p53. p53 can be divided into different functional domains: an N-terminal transactivation domain, a proline-rich domain, a DNA-binding domain ([interpro:IPR008967]), a tetramerisation domain and a C-terminal regulatory region. The tetramerisation domain of human p53 extends from residues 325 to 356, and has a 4-helical bundle fold. The tetramerisation domain is essential for DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and p53 degradation [[cite:PUB00014037], [cite:PUB00054382]].</p> <p>This superfamily also includes the structural-related C-terminal SARAH (Salvador-RassF-Hippo) domain found in tumor suppressors such as Serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 (human Hippo homologue, Mst), Serine/threonine-protein kinase 3, Serine/threonine-protein kinase cst-1 and  Serine/threonine-protein kinase hippo, which is involved in dimerisation [[cite:PUB00097384]].</p>	TRUE	FALSE
IPR036792	Aspartate carbamoyltransferase regulatory subunit, C-terminal domain superfamily	"<p>Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (aspartate transcarbamylase, ATCase) [intenz:2.1.3.2] is an allosteric enzyme that plays a central role in the regulation of the pyrimidine pathway in bacteria. The holoenzyme is a dodecamer composed of six catalytic chains, each with an active site, and six regulatory chains lacking catalytic activity [[cite:PUB00014302]]. The catalytic subunits exist as a dimer of catalytic trimers, (c3)2, while the regulatory subunits exist as a trimer of regulatory dimers, (r2)3, therefore the complete holoenzyme can be represented as (c3)2(r2)3. The association of the catalytic subunits c3 with the regulatory subunits r2 is responsible for the establishment of positive co-operativity between catalytic sites for the binding of aspartate and it dictates the pattern of allosteric response toward nucleotide effectors. ATCase from Escherichia coli is the most extensively studied allosteric enzyme [[cite:PUB00006327]]. The crystal structure of the T-state, the T-state with CTP bound, the R-state with N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) bound, and the R-state with phosphonoacetamide plus malonate bound have been used in interpreting kinetic and mutational studies.</p>

<p>A high-resolution structure of E. coli ATCase in the presence of PALA (a bisubstrate analog) allows a detailed description of the binding at the active site of the enzyme and allows a detailed model of the tetrahedral intermediate to be constructed. The entire regulatory chain has been traced showing that the N-terminal regions of the regulatory chains R1 and R6 are located in close proximity to each other and to the regulatory site. This portion of the molecule may be involved in the observed asymmetry between the regulatory binding sites as well as in the heterotropic response of the enzyme [[cite:PUB00006470]]. The C-terminal domain of the regulatory chains have a rubredoxin-like zinc-bound fold.</p> <p>This entry represents the C-terminal domain superfamily.</p>"	FALSE	FALSE
IPR036875	Zinc finger, CCHC-type superfamily	"<p>Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates [[cite:PUB00035807], [cite:PUB00035805], [cite:PUB00035806], [cite:PUB00035804], [cite:PUB00014077]]. Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and of the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. There are many superfamilies of Znf motifs, varying in both sequence and structure. They display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g. some bind DNA, others protein), suggesting that Znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. For example, Znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeleton organisation, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodelling and zinc sensing, to name but a few [[cite:PUB00035812]].

This domain was first identified as a zinc finger at the C terminus of AN1 [swissprot:Q91889], a ubiquitin-like protein in Xenopus laevis [[cite:PUB00001828]]. The AN1-type zinc finger contains six conserved cysteines and two histidines that could potentially coordinate 2 zinc atoms.</p>

<p>Certain stress-associated proteins (SAP) contain AN1 domain, often in combination with A20 zinc finger domains (SAP8) or C2H2 domains (SAP16) [[cite:PUB00042925]]. For example, the human protein Znf216 has an A20 zinc-finger at the N terminus and an AN1 zinc-finger at the C terminus, acting to negatively regulate the NFkappaB activation pathway and to interact with components of the immune response like RIP, IKKgamma and TRAF6. The interact of Znf216 with IKK-gamma and RIP is mediated by the A20 zinc-finger domain, while its interaction with TRAF6 is mediated by the AN1 zinc-finger domain; therefore, both zinc-finger domains are involved in regulating the immune response [[cite:PUB00042926]].

IPR008981	F-MuLV receptor-binding	<p>The F-MuLV receptor-binding domain forms part of the retroviral envelope glycoprotein in the murine leukaemia virus.  Envelope glycoproteins are synthesized as single chain precursors, which are subsequently cleaved into the surface subunit (SU) and the transmembrane subunit TM.  The N-terminal half of SU forms the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for binding to the cell surface receptor, the cationic amino acid transporter mCAT-1.  The RBD is structurally partitioned into a conserved β sandwich framework of Greek key topology and a variable helical loop subdomain [[cite:PUB00010668]].  The RBD contains three variable regions, VRA, VRB and VRC, which vary in sequence and length between MuLVs that use different receptors.  VRA and VRB are closely associated with one another in the helical subdomain.  There is a putative receptor-binding pocket in VRA, which may play a role in helping to determine receptor specificity [[cite:PUB00010669]].</p>	FALSE	FALSE
